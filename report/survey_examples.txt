HEMINGWAY
=========
Then the rain came. The waves were as big as elephants. The sea swelled. In the dark of our night just before the dawn I held Kate tight and I told everyone it would be all right. I said it only trying to lie so that the world would not feel so bad. Also so that nobody would dare ask me who would have to go over first, and for whom the swells rolled.

Being caught was the same as death, worse, really, in a way, because then you had to clean the comb and you got that sick feeling in the pit of your stomach, the way you do when you know that your hair is done for and there’s not a damn thing you can do about it. There was the hair club for men, but there was no glory in that and you weren’t really fooling anyone, not even your reflection.

===========

Whom I may term a Damon for thy love:
Therefore 'tis best, if so it like you all,
To send my thousand horse incontinent
To apprehend that paltry Scythian.

And, since he was so wise and honourable,
Let us afford him now the bearing hence,
And crave his triple-worthy burial.

My lord,
We have discovered the enemy
Ready to charge you with a mighty army.
