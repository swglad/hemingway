Then the rain came. The waves were as BIG as elephants. The sea swelled. In the dark of our night just before the DAWN I HELD Kate tight and I told everyone it would be all right. I said it only trying to lie so that the WORLD would not feel so BAD. Also so that nobody would dare ask me who would have to go over first, and for whom the SWELLS rolled.

In the twenty years since, she had WITNESSED not only the degeneration of the MISSION and its surrounding areas, spurred on BY industry; but more to the point, the degeneration of her soul.

SHAKESPEARE

FULL true thou speak'st, and like thyself, my lord,
Whom I may term a Damon for thy love:
THEREFORE 'TIS BEST, if so it like you all,
To send my THOU horse incontinent
To apprehend that paltry Scythian.

And crave his triple-worthy burial.

We have DISCOVERED the ENEMY
Ready to charge YOU with a mighty army.
