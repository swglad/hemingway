HEMINGWAY
=========
Then the rain came. The waves were as big as elephants. The sea swelled. In the dark of our night just before the dawn I held Kate tight and I told everyone it would be all right. I said it only trying to lie so that the world would not feel so bad. Also so that nobody would dare ask me who would have to go over first, and for whom the swells rolled.

She began to cry, the tears that can make a man remember hope. I made her look up into the wet rain and I told her the story that the tall bullfighter in Palermo told me so long ago. That there are nine galaxies in this universe for every single one of us and that in just our own Milky Way there are sixty-nine suns for each person alive. That if we only face the fear that is the raging bull with courage every single day we will survive for one more day to find the light.

The desert sun was hot. They were all a long ride from home. Home had been a bakery. A damned fine one. Brett Bagelette was spread out on the sand. She had a title. Lady Bagel. She only used it when she was sliced.

Besides this, it was observed with great uneasiness by the people that the weekly bills in general increased very much during these weeks, although it was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very moderate.

It was the mysterious taint of the blood; the poor mother had brought it from her own ancient race. The evil had broken out once or twice in the father's family, long before Lady Steyne's sins had begun, or her fasts and tears and penances had been offered in their expiation. The pride of the race was struck down as the first-born of Pharaoh. The dark mark of fate and doom was on the thresholdâ€”the tall old threshold surmounted by coronets and caned heraldry.

This commonplace result was what Gwendolen found herself threatened with even in the novelty of the first winter at Offendene. What she was clear upon was, that she did not wish to lead the same sort of life as ordinary young ladies did; but what she was not clear upon was, how she should set about leading any other, and what were the particular acts which she would assert her freedom by doing.

SHAKESPEARE
===========
Full true thou speak'st, and like thyself, my lord,
Whom I may term a Damon for thy love:
Therefore 'tis best, if so it like you all,
To send my thousand horse incontinent
To apprehend that paltry Scythian.
How like you this, my honourable lords?
Is it not a kingly resolution?

Faith, and, Techelles, it was manly done;
And, since he was so wise and honourable,
Let us afford him now the bearing hence,
And crave his triple-worthy burial.

My lord,
We have discovered the enemy
Ready to charge you with a mighty army.
