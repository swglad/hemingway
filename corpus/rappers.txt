Ayo , black , its time , word ( Word , its time , man )
Its time , man ( Aight , man , begin )
Straight out the fucking dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas dont make it back
dont know how to start this shit , yo

Rappers , monkey flip em with the funky rhythm be kickin
Musician , inflictin composition of pain
Im like Scarface sniffin cocaine
Holding an M16 , see with the pen Im extreme , now
Bullet holes left in my peepholes
Im suited up in street clothes , hand me nine and Ill defeat foes
Yall know my steelo with or without the airplay
keep some & , sitting bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner betting Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughing at baseheads tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick , forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscing about the last time the Task Force flipped
Niggas be running through the block shootin
Time to start the revolution , catch body , head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard , the Mac-10 was in the grass and
ran like cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
Pick the Mac up , told brothers , " Back up , " the Mac spit
Heard few chicks scream , my arm shook , couldnt look
Gave another squeeze , heard it click , " Yo , my shit is stuck "
Try to cock it , it wouldnt shoot , now Im in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So now Im jetting to the building lobby
And it was full of children probably couldnt see as high as be
( So what you sayin ? ) Its like the game aint the same
Got younger niggas pulling the triggers bringing fame to their name
And claim some corners , crews without guns are goners
45s and gauges , Macs , in fact
Same niggas will catch back-to back , snatching your cracks in black
There was snitch on the block getting niggas knocked
So hold your stash til the coke price drop
know this crackhead who said shes got to smoke nice rock
And if its good , shell bring you customers in measuring pots
But yo , you gotta slide on vacation , inside information
Keeps large niggas erasin and their wives basin
It drops deep as it does in my breath
never sleep , cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence , life is defined
think of crime when Im in New York state of mind

New York state of mind

Be having dreams that Im gangsta , drinking Moets , holding Tecs
Making sure the cash came correct , then stepped
Investments in stocks , sewing up the blocks to sell rocks
Winning gunfights with mega-cops
But just nigga walking with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
aint the type of brother made for you to start testin
Give me Smith & Wesson , have niggas undressin
Thinking of cash flow , buddah and shelter
Whenever frustrated , Im hijack Delta
In the PJs , my blend tape plays , bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed , each block is like maze
Full of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed
From what hear in all the stories when my peoples come back , black
Im living where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack , just max , dream can sit back
And lamp like Capone , with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life , rings flooded with stones , holmes
got so many rhymes , dont think Im too sane
Life is parallel to Hell but must maintain
And be prosperous , though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me , blaming us , were held like hostages
Its only right that was born to use mics
And the stuff that write is even tougher than dykes
Im taking rappers to new plateau , through rap slow
My rhymin is vitamin held without capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps , full of villains and creeps
Thats where learned to do my hustle , had to scuffle with freaks
Im an addict for sneakers , 20s of buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets can greet ya , about blunts teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
never sleep , cause sleep is the cousin of death
lay puzzle as backtrack to earlier times
Nothings equivalent to the New York state of mind


Fuck Jay !
( Whats up niggas , ayo , know you aint talking bout me , dog , you ? what ? )
Fuck Jay !
( You been on my dick nigga , you love my style , nigga )
Fuck Jay !

( ) Fuck with your soul like ether
( Not ) Gods Son across the belly
( Lose ) prove you lost already

Brace yourself for the main event
Yall impatiently waiting
Its like an AIDS test
Whats the result , not positive
Whos the best , Pac , Nas and . .
embrace yall with napalm
Blowed up , no guts left , chest / face gone
How could Nas be garbage
Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome
Come out of my throne
got this locked since 9-1
am the truest
Name rapper that aint influenced
Gave yall chapters but now keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame , kept my name in his music


Ive been fucked over
Left for dead , dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out , they hoped that Id be gone , stiff and rotten
Yall just piss on me , shit on me , spit on my grave
Talk about me , laugh behind my back but in my face
Yall some well wishers , friendly acting , envy hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money , man , how much can take
When these streets keep calling , heard it when was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a Fella Records wanted beef
Started cocking up my weapon , slowly loading up this ammo
To explode it on camel and his soldiers
can handle this for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint
First Biggies your man , then you got the nerve to say
That you better than . . , dick-sucking lips
Why dont you let the late , great veteran live

. . . will . . . not . . . lose
Gods son across the belly , prove you lost already
The king is back , where my crown at
Ill Will rest in peace , lets do it niggas


Yall niggas deal with emotions like bitches
Whats sad is love you cause youre my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child , Ive watched you grow up to be famous
And now smile like proud dad
Watchin his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissing women
Were you abused as child , scared to smile , they called you ugly
Well life is harsh ; hug me , dont reject me
Or make records to disrespect me , blatant or indirectly
In 88 you was getting chased through your building
Callin my crib and aint even give you my numbers
All did was gave you style for you to run with
Smiling in my face , glad to break bread with the God
Wearing Jaz chains , no Tecs , no cash , no cars
No jail bars Jigga , no pies , no case
Just Hawaiian shirts , hanging with little Chase
You fan , phony , fake , pussy , Stan
still whip your ass , you thirty-six in karate class
You Tae-Bo ho , tryna work it out , you tryna get brolic
Ask me if Im tryna kick knowledge
Nah , Im tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether , that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy , Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy ?
Oh , get it , you Biggie and hes Puffy
Rocafella died of AIDS , that was the end of his chapter
And thats the guy yall chose to name your company after ?
Put it together , rock hoes , yall rock fellas
And now yall try to take my spot , fellas
Feel these hot rocks fellas , put you in dry spot , fellas
In pine box with nine shots from my Glock , fellas
Foxy got you hot , cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think , you getting girls now cause of your looks
Ne-gro please , you no mustache having
With whiskers like rat , compared to Beans you whack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass , went from Jaz to hanging with Kane , to Irv , to . .
And Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You dick-riding faggot , you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas , ask Russell Simmons , ha

R-O get gunned up and clapped quick
. . Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z , damn you on Jaz dick
So little shortys getting gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggies rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit , apologize , nigga , just ask Kiss

( AZ ) Ayo whats up whats up lets keep it real son
Count this money , you know what Im sayin
( Nas ) Yeah yeah
( AZ ) Ayo put the Grants over there in the safe you know what Im sayin
Cause we spendin these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey , you know how that go
( Nas ) Im sayin thats what this is all about right
Clothes , bankrolls and hoes you know what Im sayin
Yo then what man , what

Visualizing the realism of life in actuality
Fuck whos the baddest , persons status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
Im destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
Cause yeah , we were beginners in the hood as percenters
But somethin musta got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some rest in peace and some are sittin in San Quentin
Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition
Keeping this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though , we know somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leaving thievin
Well be leavin with some kind of dough , so
Until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers , will be somewhere stackin plenty papers
Keeping it real , packing steel , getting high
Cause lifes bitch and then you die

Lifes bitch and then you die
Thats why we get high
Cause you never know when youre gonna go
Lifes bitch and then you die
Thats why we puff lye
Cause you never know when youre gonna go

woke up early on my born day ; Im 20 , its blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body , now Im fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated cause made it
One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one , cuss while pus from
My skull cause its pain in my brain vein , money maintain
Dont go against the grain , simple and plain
When was young , at this used to do my thing hard
Robbin foreigners , take their wallets , their jewels , and rip their green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
Got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
Now its all about cash in abundance
Niggas used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
switched my motto ; instead of saying " fuck tomorrow "
That buck that bought bottle couldve struck the lotto
Once stood on the block , loose cracks produce stacks
cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is Illmatic , keep static like wool fabric
Pack 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage


United States in fear
London knows Im phantom , South Korea knows Im here
Posted , planted without exception
Rise to your feet for this gravity
Nas and Dilla beat , the fly soliloquy
Some real nigga talkin
This dont happen too often , take precaution
Liars and frauds got you exhausted
Youve been accosted
Who told you Id lost it ?
just put it down for second , damn
Can the king lounge for second , kick his hooves up ?
Grow stubble on the face for once without smooth cut ?
Grow little gut , cant even enjoy the fruit of my labor
Before they call me Luke and hand me my lightsaber
The rulers back , you can tell by the trumpets
Prince of Wales sent me tea , biscuits , crumpets
Jewelry cost more than the car , car cost 200
Get out your chair , the season of Nasir

( Da-da da-da da
Da-da da-da da )
The season
( Da-da da-da da
Da-da da-da da )
This is the season
( Da-da da-da da
Da-da da-da da )
The season
( Da-da da-da da
Da-da da-da da )

Jay Elec doesnt write it
HOV couldnt write it , he vacationin
Jungle the only brother take shit from
Hassan give me lines , we talk all the time
So guess if he inspired my song it aint mine
Let me make this clear , they fear the gifted
Some say Shakespeare never existed
Wow , now , look at the amount of resistance
Attempts to chisel my face , from the mountain you guessed it
Bitch you guessed it
There , did answer your questions ?
So , now thats out the way lets get back to my message
Now Im 40 and little change
Ride around , sport new Benz , little Range
Havin fun , my little man gettin big
He and my daughter down , when we talk its real
Nothin is watered down , young boy swag
Im here today as well as the 90s
But the past life , my ass is behind me
Ignite the pyrex
Try to bite this , get Nasty Nas-itis
Arthritis when you try to write this
Asking why is the Feds at my niggas ?
Why the Feds at my niggas ?
know by now should be talkin bread , crack , and figures
But not stressin , knot stressin
Im survivin , Im survivin
Its funny when catch cops textin and drivin
Who questions and penalizes them ?
One day well have their ass in court and well be tryin them
Hey yo , its love for Detroit , Mo-Town , Motor City
Dilla lives on , its like he wrote it with me
The soulful sample complements my rhyme so well
Slacks by Zegna , or YSL
Matchin the Saint Laurents , Im fly as hell
Hands in the air , the season of Nasir


Yeah , Its that time , yeah , Dilla rest in peace , what up Detroit ?
Fly ladies , dope dealers and killers
Worldwide , NY , yeah , yeah , the season , yeah , this is the season

Its yours
Whose world is this ?
[ Nas ] : The world is yours , the world is yours
Its mine , its mine , its mine ; whose world is this ?

sip the Dom , watching Gandhi til Im charged
Then writing in my book of rhymes , all the words past the margin
To hold the mic Im throbbin , mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thiefs theme play me at night , they wont act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like crack pipe
The mind activation , react like Im facing
Time like Pappy Mason , with pens Im embracing
Wipe the sweat off my dome , spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruising in Six cab or Montero Jeep
cant call it ; the beats make me falling asleep
keep falling , but never falling six feet deep
Im out for presidents to represent me ( say what ? )
Im out for presidents to represent me ( say what ? )
Im out for dead presidents to represent me


To my man Ill Will , God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens , God bless your life
trip , we box up crazy bitches , aimin guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police , release scriptures thats maybe Hitlers
Yet Im the mild , money-gettin style , rollin foul
The versatile , honey-sticking wild golden child
Dwelling in the Rotten Apple , you get tackled
Or caught by the devils lasso , shit is hassle
Theres no days for broke days we sell it : smoke pays
Of holy water , odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinking word best describing my life to name my daughter
My strength , my son , the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction , all the wrong shit did , hell lead right direction
How you living , large broker charge , cards are mediocre
You flippin coke or playin spit , spades , and strip poker ?


Im the young city bandit hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps kick my thoughts alone , get remanded
Born alone , die alone , no crew to keep my crown or throne
Im deep by sound alone , caved inside , , 000 miles from home
need new nigga for this black cloud to follow
Cause while its over me its too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain , flip , fill the clip to the tip
Picturing my peeps not eating can make my heartbeat skip
And Im amped up , they locked the champ up , even my brains in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana , stabbing women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile , plus profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes , burning dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with bop , checkin dames
Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today

Here we are
Here we are
Yeah
This one right here is for the people

[ Hook ] x2
Sabali , sabali , sabali yonkote
Sabali , sabali , sabali kiye

Hey yo
Lets go all the way in on this one

Some of the smartest dummies
Cant read the language of Egyptian mummies
An flag on moon
And cant find food for the starving tummies
Pay no mind to the youths
Cause its not like the future depends on it
But save the animals in the zoo
Cause the chimpanzee dem make big money
This is how the media pillages
On the TV the picture is
Savages in villages
And the scientist still cant explain the pyramids , huh
Evangelists making living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images
And this is what the image is
You buy khaki pants
And all of sudden you say Indiana Jones
An thief out gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzis Ive ever seen and ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see
And thats all they will ever show
So the ones in the West
Will never move East
And feel like they could be at home
Dem get tricked by the beast
But where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown ?
Solomonic linage whe dem still cant defeat and them coulda never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and will forever Own Lord

[ Hook ] x2

Yeah , Sabali . Thats patience . Thats what the old folks told me
Discovering the World before this World . World buried in time
Uncover with rhymes . It gets no realer

Huh , we born not knowing , are we born knowing all ?
We growing wiser , are we just growing tall ?
Can you read thoughts ? can you read palms ?
Huh , can you predict the future ? can you see storms , coming ?
The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off
Now the Earth is round
If the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh
The average man cant prove of most of the things
That he chooses to speak of
And still wont research and find out
The root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in Universities and claim that theyre smart and cunning
Tell them find cure when we sneeze
And thats when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up , when we get cut
Man heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wet mud
Can you read signs ? can you read stars ?
Can you make peace ? can you fight war ?
Can you milk cows , even though you drive cars ? huh
Can you survive ? Against all odds , now ?

[ Hook ] x2

Its crazy when you feed people the truth you dont know how theyre gonna react
Youre scared of wrong doers , people that just ignorant
Youre scared of the truth , be patient for now

Who wrote the Bible ? Who wrote the Quran ?
And was it lightning storm
That gave birth to the Earth
And then dinosaurs were born ? damn
Who made up words ? Who made up numbers ?
And what kind of spell is mankind under ?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it
Microwaved it and try it
No matter what well survive it
Whats hue ? Whats man ? Whats human ?
Anything along the land we consuming
Eatin , deletin , ruin
Trying to get paper
Gotta have land , gotta have acres
So can sit back like Jack Nicholson
Watch niggas play the game like the Lakers
In world full of 52 fakers
Gypsies , seances , mystical prayers
You superstitious ? throw salt over your shoulders
Make wish for the day cuz
Like somebody got doll of me
Stickin needles in my arteries
But cant feel it
Sometimes its like part of me , but got real big spirit
Im fearless . . . . Im fearless
Dont you try and grab hold of my soul
Its like military soldier since seven years old
held real dead bodies in my arms
Felt their body turn cold , oh
Why we born in the first place
If this is how we gotta go ?
Damn

This goes to all the wisdom and knowledge seekers of the World
Sabali , Patience , yeah

Fake thug , no love
You get the slug CB4 Gusto
Your luck low , didnt know til was drunk though
You freak niggas played out , get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch , got the gauge out
Ninety-six ways made out , Montana way
The Good-F E-L L-A
Verbal AK spray
Dipped attache
Jump out the Range empty out the ashtray
glass of ze make man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots , murder schemes , thirty-two shotguns
Regulate with my Dunns
Seventeen rocks gleam from one ring
Yo , let me let yall niggas know one thing
Theres one life , one love , so there can only be one King
The highlights of living
Vegas-style roll dice in linen
Antera spinning on Millenniums
Twenty bets Im winning em
Threats Im sending em
Lex with TV sets the minimum
Ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains
case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique , with the semi-tech who want it
Diamonds flaunt it , chicken heads flock lace em
Fried broiled with basil , taste em , crack the legs
Way out of formation its horizontal how have em
Fuckin me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon
Grab your gun , its on though
Shit is grimy , real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke Mac it wont spray right
Dont give fuck who they hit as long as the dramas lit
Yo , overnight thugs bug cause they aint promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligan , stay on that piranha-shit

never sleep , cause sleep is the cousin of death
aint the type of brother made for you to start testin

peeped you frontin
was in the Jeep sunk in the seat
Tinted with heat , beats bumpin
Across the street you was wilding
Talkin bout how you ran the Island in 89
Laying up , playin the yard with crazy shine
cocked baby , that nigga grave be mine
Clanked him
What was he thinkin on my corner when its pay me time ?
Dug em , you owe me cousin something told me plug him
So dumb , felt my leg burn then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped son
Caught hot one , somebody take this biscuit fore the cops come
Then they came asking me my name , what the fuck
got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night , what
Got my gat back , time to backtrack
had the drop so how the fuck get clapped
Black was in the Jeep , watching all these scenes speed by
It was brown Datsun , and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown niggas through , blazin at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely , hear me
So when rhyme its sincerely yours
Be lightin Ls sipping Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin war niggas was cool with before
We used to score together , Uptown copping the raw
But , thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers , word up

Yall know my steelo
There aint an army that could strike back

Thug niggas
Yo , to them thug niggas getting it on in the world you know
To them niggas thats locked down
Doing they thing surviving yaknowmsaying
To my thorough niggas New York and World wide
Yo to the Queensbridge Militia
96 shit , The Firm clique
Illmatic nigga It Was Written though
Its been long time coming
Yall fake niggas , trying to copy
Better come with the real though
Fake ass niggas yo
They throw us slugs we throwing em back , what
Bring the shit man , live man
Fuck that son
Nine-six shit

What up ?
Escobar season begins
Repent your sins
Nine-Six Check it

Spark the lye with the eight-forty fly
Pretty thug show no love its like when doves cry
Maybe Im just too demanding , parked the Land
Mark Buchanan , fuck job Imma die scramblin
Digger gold , dig bigger hole in ya soul
Que Pasa , Pablos throne cabron
At the airport the Mobb picked me up in truck
Jewelry chunky like fuck never scared to get stuck
So whats the deal Papi ?
Heard the feds could of knocked me
Had the cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiating , my name holds weight , we motivatin
Hustling , as if God was dancing with Satan
The Firm waitin , to get ajourned cause we facing
Double life , thuggin for life , you taste it
The white numbin ya toungue
bought it from Dominicans
suitcase of benjamins swung tight in his fingers
Had the Firm gun slingers , hit the lights , grab the white
Murder everything in site , and jet in the beamers
Now im home with the phone screaner
Resting the stones in jewelry cleaner
Checkin my mail reading my supoena
To the witness standing , got remanded
Livin on the 4th building and cant stand it
Gotta fight my case from the inside
Niggas telling , felt it coming when my pockets started swelling
But thats the game for ya
Hid stash to ya lawyers
Supreme court , Queens New York will bore ya
Suited up , booted up , with the jail cut
Million dollar bail what ?
put up the house and was out
Word the Fuck Up
Time to get the shit on son
Tryna trap nigga
Incarcerate me yo
Check it tho , yo , yo

Im gonna make it if try , cross my heart hope to die
( cross my heart hope to die )
Im gonna make it if try , cross my heart hope to die

Praise the Lord , ive been scarred with hot water
Days are shorter , next court dates around the corner
Money aint the same , shit is outta order
Since the days of Rich Porter
Something gotta give , aint trying to bid
Now run up in cribs , body shit , but no women no kids
In the Bridge where the murderers live
used to make quarter million monthly
was ill until they sunk me
Killed the snitch with the pump shots
Bought passport off junkie
The Firm helped me flee out the country
Word and Im out , Pakastinian land
Chilling with my man Jungle
The commissioner Stout
Killa , what it is nigga firm biz
[ Nas ] Yeah , hahaha

" When flow for the street . . " " . . who else could it be "
" Nas . . "

[ Nas ] 1st Verse
Yo
Explode , my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back , before Nasir would explore career in rap
As music dude , mastered this Rubiks Cube
Godzilla , fought Gargantua , eyes glued to the tube
Was , long time ago , John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin out Chryslers , e-z wider paper
Pops puffin his cess , punchin his chest like gorilla
Outside was psychoes , killers
Saw Divine , Goon and Jungle , Lil Turkey
. . . Tyrone , member no cursin front of Ms . Vercey
Big Percy , Crazy Paul , the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16 , once in the blue , hallways was clean
knew , all that Id seen had meant somethin
Learned early , to fear none little Nas was huntin
Livin carefree laughin , got jokes on the daily
Yall actin like some old folks yall dont hear me
Yo Im in my second childhood

" Cause when flow the for the street . . " " . . who else could it be "
" N-A " " Nas . . "
" Resurrect , through the birth of my seed . . " " Queensbridge "
" Make everything right . . " " Get yours , nigga "

[ Nas ] 2nd Verse
Yo , dude is 31 , livin in his moms crib
Ex-convict , was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair , still slingin , got crew
They break his moms furniture , watchin Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smokin Ls
In the same spot he stood since eighty-five , well
When his stash slow , he be crazy
Saved by his moms , hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout , teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave , no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers , different blocks , different years
Sittin on , different benches like its musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life , hes on the corners at night
With young dudes its them he wanna be like
Its sad but its fun to him right ? He never grew up
31 and cant give his youth up , hes in his second childhood


[ Nas ] 3rd Verse
Baby girl shes always talkin name droppin hangin late
Drinkin smokin hates her baby daddy , craves shoppin
poppin Ecstasy takin , wont finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin , stuck with limitations
Lustin men , many hotels , Fendi Chanel
With nothin in her bank account frontin she do well
Her kid suffers he dont get that love he deserve
He the Sun , she the Earth , single mom , even worse
No job never stay workin , mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin she the same person , never matures
All her friends married doin well
Shes in the streets yakkety yakkin like she was 12
Honey is twenty-seven , argues fights
Selfish in her own right for life , guess shes in her second childhood

Crack fucked up the world , and wonder if they realized the damage
mean , they come from an era who made lot of money of that shit
wonder if it fucked with their conscience
It fucked with me being out there , couldnt stand it
couldnt stand seeing people fucking themselves up like that on the shit
And thats where the money came from

48 , 48 , 48 states get it in
48 , 48 , 48 states get it in
They call me Mr . Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow
can get it for the low

Shit is getting warmer on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners
Your mother is goner
warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got daughter , shits getting harder
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You cant afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore aint saw ya
You got mother , she dont support you
But you bought her new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had roof
Now you got coupe and it doesnt have roof
So you bought two , nigga
They coming for you , nigga
Niggas be hating Im doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
Who was alludin all of this potent
You can blame me motherfucker , for killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger , all wanted was cheeseburger


Nigga , we broke as fuck
Homie got chop shop stole that truck
And sold that dope
Motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke
Could have been actor and won that Oscar , said , Im sorry
But got nice car , put my sister through school
While my momma all cool , Im sorry

You get addicted to the flip , we used to call it
You get addicted to the flip , the transaction , the hustling
Even more than the money , its just your job
You feel like its your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person , and to do this and do that
Way too deep , scare the shit out of you
You wind up with so much work , that youd be scared to death
Its important for us to realize man , we gotta get out of that , man
Dudes is buying choppers to shoot down people that look just like them
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other , nobody wins
Ya know what mean ?

From the bridge ever summer deal
Niggas run to steal
Cracks and bundles
Wanna be down ask Jungle
React humble but we blast guns too
Now to son you is deeper plan
So when jam
Reach the pan
Check the sale let the sound scan
Keep brown tan
From vacationing
Chicks in Vegas
Tryna guess us how much we made to spin
Two Tiphannys from the Colosseum
Green olive BMs
Tracks from TM lack when we see em
Grip the heat
When the sixth season
Jump out the S4s
And test yours
Tudor watches
Allah watches
Stubborn , you wont admit that Escobar got this
On top let me explain what the cock is
Firm Biz came livin
Naturally fly , diamond rings glistenin
Make it seem sickenin
Whats really ill is how the teams clickin
Femme Fatale on some dope shit
Flow sick we stay incorporate
Firm giving you dosage
Of high explosives
You kidnap we kidnap
You blast shit , did that
Cuttin through the chase we bring it to where you live at

Id rather try you by your label


Miss maximillion
Exotic diamonds let it charm
Legal life of bear arms
Protecting my squad from harm
Murder , Danger
Backstabbers and snakes
Murderers and Jakes
Spend thugs but the drugs case

And them accusations you make me
Wow femme fatale we increasing the stakes
Platinum plates choosin isles

With the lugas true das
Stats rulas

Slow regez the elegant black prince
We take the top gator
Black and shrotopass like im raider
Sophistacater
Hang tight like dre right
Flow like hawian in the broad day light

All in my power to see the day
That the crowd weighted
You expired and outdated
Re segregated
None of my people graduated
Aint no progress in the projects
Its the same process
Rise to the top of New York
Keep the digest
Through all my cornets
Global solar

The shuffuler
We analyze who they really are
Familiar , blow holes into your interior
You minute , little man
You think you general ?

Fake thugs styles glued together
Saying old rhymes show signs
Youre through whatever
Eat your heart out

Fiend to be part of the squad
But Im not gonna be shot down
Whos how now ? Im disgusted at you
Rap doo doo
Its funny if you let these cats fool you
The whole no wait
Your values dying at slow rate
Opposition track live niggas pop gats
Been doin this since the days of hot tracks
Claimin you in the firm hows that ?
When you got your spot jacked

The foulest dreams was lead to blind
Tonight is excellence redefined
In the form of Nature , Noreaga
Nas , Mary . Blige
Femme Fetale on the rise
Manager extraordinaire
My man , Jungle
Pussy rebundled like desert plans
Spitting vivid raps
My whole clique rocking fitted hats
Millionaire status play the block give it back
Thanks to who ?
My pen names tight like langston hughes
Generating chips , picking which banks to choose
Clever robberies , on deposits

Stare at bitches gossip

From day one rap whole new guns
That run in the family

Wa dada dang wa da da dang Hey Listen to my mac milli just go bang

Caught hot one , somebody take this biscuit fore the cops come

Got my gat back , time to backtrack

In mines , Im like an with air macs nikes on
Recite nice on mics strike like python
My gold chain with ice on lookin trife on
My Jacuzzi filled with tight warm relaxed lookin steaming
Lounging like falcon on mountain top at Egypt

God bless the life of my man nino


Its sort of like the conclusion to " Color Purple "
Brothas is losing , confusion , with one time all pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop verses the block , shorties is too quick
Lesson number one . If youre arrested and hung
Where Brothas is from gotta keep lid on your tongue
Its like silent murder , hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of prince in palace of Persia
The cognac plurger plus the trees
But whose the faul one to make his nose take freeze
And got enough gold to rock ice in all hype
Used to be general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white feinds and all-nighters , collect calls from lifers
Astoria walls with cypress , but yo thats another subject
love teks lets get it off
Yo what up what up


Yo funkmaster flex you know got the ill lex
wear my guests in apendix
And cash my cheque in flesh shit
My man escobar be lighting weed
And proceed with all the ill types of rhymes you need
Im not the new jack , or crew rack Im like the next man
Cormega , just got signed to Def Jam
My man Nas is down with me
lot of sucker rappers they cant diss me
Its like that , you know its like that
Well strike back Queensbridge style
My mobb deep people is mad foul
juvenile delinquent wet your prequit

Its frequent my man Ike
Tried to avalanche ice watch
You know my steelo Al Pacino
Yo Escobar

Escobar season
Cormega reason
We with it what
Ill stay high triple beamin
Queensbridge

You cocked back
You thought you had it planned
You thought you had your man
He saw you coming , he ran when you tried to blast that man
You missed him by inches , he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of em pull through but one didnt , sons finished
You took the life of him
The part about it thats crazy , you was aight with him
Tight with him , why was he in the way
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day
His style never hollas loud , stays reclusive
Good dude , got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick , one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why , cause of

Accident murderer , act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag , you put work in
You aint mean to murk him
Your guns virgin
Streets are full of em
Read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer

We grew up doing graffiti
Now hollow heads getting heated
Seated in foreign cars , constantly getting weeded
Proceeded to count profits
know they got on binoculars
But fuck em all , we balling til they come lock us up
Twenty to life ; Im clubbing , blowing twenty tonight
We the mob , Bob Marley Marlin all through the night
Addicted to wealth , never cold turkey to war
Snatch tec off the shelf , live forever ; thats InshAllah
Memoirs of rich nigga ;
Sweat suits , gold chains , old drug dealers
New Benz , chrome rims are for show , killer
You niggas accidental , shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes , stay alive , cant be dodging my clique
Cut check ; use your bitch for some bargaining chips
In hole , sell your home , nigga go sell your soul
This forty-five in control
God forgives and dont


Accident murderer , accident murderer
You just an accident murderer

Yo , for my nigga that got killed , got hit up
Vodka spills on the concrete
Light swisha , we miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home , shot in the dome
How they gon kill that beautiful sista
Violent adolescents , homicidal with weapons
Not lot of knowledge inside of they minds , that Im guessing
Tell me who you impressing
Shooters knew them when they was babies
used to test them
Make em throw up they hands , choke em out playing wrestling
Watch em grow to man
see them now they repping
But they cold-blooded , homie
Wondering where the respect went
Cant play with these little niggas , gangsta little niggas
Cant hang with these little niggas , they killing , they reckless
Wish could build with him , but will he change really
Some real killers
think of Wayne Perry
Think of my nigga Drawz
But you arent name to me you aint mean to kill him
It wasnt necessary
You cocked back
You thought you had it planned , you thought you had your man
He saw you comin , he ran when you tried to blast that man
You missed him by inches , he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of em pull through , but one didnt , sons finished
You took the life of him
The part about it thats crazy , you was aiight with him
Tight with him , why was he in the way ?
Why was he standin next to the enemy that specific day ?
His style never hollas loud , stays reclusive
Good dude , got that look like he always about to do shit

You aint mean to kill him , it wasnt necessary


Born on June 4th the mind of Gemini
Plight of societal OutKast Aquemeni
You bought hammer just to silence the clamour
For another real on the block , after your man got popped
When shots rang out , you ran for cover
Bought your first gun , spent couple grand for another four
Told your mom you was preparing for war
She signed the shape of the cross each time you ran out the door
But you aint never had the mind of killer
You was more of an actor with the movement of small time dealer
When the feds came they got you for light work
Facing few years , defence attorney told you it might work
To cop plea and turn informant you could save few tenants
And at the same time reduce your sentence
You wore wire to the home of your old supplier
And when they raided , you aint make it you was caught in the fire
Of an accident murderer

[ Intro : & Sample ] ( Nas )
Im from the other side of town ( For real ) out of bounds
To anybody , who dont live around
never learned to share or , how to care ( Light somethin up )
never had no teachings , about being fair

Yo ! Thank God for the Rolls symbol on my hood
Silver lady with the wind she pop up pretty wood interior
stay good nigga , dont speak on facts unless you correct you losin respect
Ferrari floors are clean , draws are clean , what !
Verses , all my bars are mean
Lil money , lil risk , lil faith , lil guidance
It aint rocket science your prophet try to be honest
Paul Wall deemed , IWC watches
But aint walk around with no poodle under my armpit
Actin all she she , cause aint got it easy
been through it , slim through never PG

[ Hook ] :
You across the track , completly relaxed
You take warning back , dont you never come back
You across the track , completly relaxed
You take warning back , dont you never come back

Dont you ever try to stop the uprisin of Kingdom
got enough bars to take away your fuckin freedom
My arms long enough to box the devil could beat him
If his arms long enough to box God Im weave him
He wanna learn hes starvin for knowledge Im feed em
But if he wise Im hungry for for knowledge Im heat em
If you was manifestin all them lessons that you readin
You would even believe in the teachings that you preachin
Heathens sneak even left leakin in the beacon
The gangs peeped him they In Living Color like Keenen
And hell aint talkin about breathin
Stupid why you reachin my hand stay on the pound like Lincoln
Im powerful you weaklin , the firin pen went to the spring
Summer , fall like the seasons in your region
Papoose and Nas is legion
Everything happens for reason , have good evenin

[ Hook ] :
You across the track , completly relaxed
You take warning back , dont you never come back
You across the track , completly relaxed
You take warning back , dont you never come back

This is what , this what they want huh
This is what its all about
Time to take Affirmative Action son
They just dont understand , you knamean
Niggas coming sideways thinking stuff is sweet man
Niggas dont understand the four devils ; lust , envy , hate , jealousy
Wicked niggas , man

Yo sit back , relax , catch ya contact , sip your cog-ni ac
And lets all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack new cat sit back , worth top dollar
In fact touch mines and Ill react like Rottweiler
Who could relate , we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch em and break , undress em , tie em with tape no escape
The Corleone , fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn , The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone , face it homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats , politickin daily with diplomats
See me Im an official mack , Lex Coupe triple black

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destinys to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die , he too soft
That niggas dead on , key of her-oin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
put the hit out
Yo , the smoothest killer since Bugsy , bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be , wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo , my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up bring your heater all your cream go between us
Real shit , my Desert Eagle got ill grip
chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam , made dread scream and sprayed Fed team
Corleone be turning niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus , Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections its The Firm nigga set it

Yo , my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
shine jewelry sipping on crushed grapes , we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
Its sickening , he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
Its logic as long as its nobody thats in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr . Coffee
Feds cost me two mill to get the system off me
Lifes bitch but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
Ill be flooded with ice so hell fire cant scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque

In the black Camaro
Firm deep , all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabees be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
Money bags got Moet Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two
They aint got clue what we about to do
My whole team , we shitting hard like Czar
Sosa , Foxy Brown , Cormega and Escobar
keep fat marquess piece
Laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters , Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm baby , from BK to the Bridge
My nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz
So what the deal is
keep phat jew-el , sipping Crist-ies
Sitting on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The Gods they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with case of Cristal and Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke , raw though
An ounce mixed with leak thats pure though
Flipping the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper
He had fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait its half-and half
Keys is one and two-fifth , so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw , chop it in half
Get sixteen , double it times three
We got forty-eight , which mean whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four , subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So lets see , if we flip this other key
Then thats more for me , mad coke and mad leak
Plus five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki
The Firm baby , volume one
Check it , uhh
Protect this , nigga for the necklace
throw the death wish ; the pretty slim sex shit
The rep this , remember Fox said this
We on some next shit , we are blessed this
The scares on our backs mean we met this
To lie for em
The 25 sentence to keep my eyes on em
Im straight , knowing when Allahs shine on em
Shitty drugs and drama , opposite three pretty thugs and don momma
Filling the rest , the steel in their chest
When Boogs threw the kiss of death , it was over
And we laid out , chill was open off the way he ate out
It was real , foreal was fucking with mills and he was frag-ile
We wyling , the brown stallion
Stay styling , on the low fouling
The whole Firm wyling , we lucked it
know the trick bitch he fuck with , on some duct shit
Heard through the grade that she sucked it
Firm , Sos and Esco , mad loco
Fox and Mega for whatever , and through this cheddar
We gon stay family , til we fry though
The fam will never split even if one of us die though
Along with our get gos , we gon blaze til it brick-os
Peep the Ill-Na Na , sweet taboo
The Firm tattoo on the Dada
Now tell me what crew hold it down like we do da da ?

Til the death of this , murderous moves pursue effortless
Ice necklace , high priced dressed executives
Peep the grammar , slim built , strong stamina
Forty-four nickel plate long with the silencer
Play for keeps in shut eye you stay sleep
Shit remain deep in get shells thrown at ya Range jeep
Giuliani suite got all the kings going up for creek
Devil life beers now whos left controlling the streets ?
No intelligence , strictly slow niggas minds negligence
Its evident , Feds mess up , raid ya residents
Were all for living , heavyweight Firm division
Mind , check mine , eat swans , cause its religion
You know the steez , take aim , cock and squeeze
Its the prophecies , not the philosophies of Socrates
Next up ? ( Yo believe thats me )
Ayo Mega , represent for the family

Ayo , the Feds got me in the top ten
Cause when my door got knocked in
My four-four main cocked in
My sinister mind , shines like Dillinger
Mega exhausted , Babyface crime Emperor
Yo , life is based on cultures and creeds
And peep the way drug fiends , the thug nigga sees
Ive seen niggas lined up , handcuffed and tied-up
Coke prices rise up when drugs supply dry-up
The Millennium drives up
Rims semi blinds ya eyes temporarily
Mind of Mega be heavily armed for felonies
Shine you could never see
The next fat cat out of NYC
It Was Written like ghetto life hieroglyphics
Living since my real niggas bailed me out of prison
lot of schemes , cause the narcotics team in Queens
Had marked dollars then the knowledge of fiends
My dream is the legacy of Montana treasury
Fake thugs couldnt even take slugs or bury me

To all thoroughbreds taking the corners , yall need to join us
Firms most powerful nation of rap performers
High class , Generals , Confidence , paying lawyers
Swift as Oscar De La Hoya , green beret warriors
Fakes peep them like the . Kennedy tape
In the new with Jew busting all in the face
Another word yo , you see through
My man built the Sugar Hill from sweet tooth
We all eat , cause speak truth and educated
Black youth , street diploma
Teach Greeks and Romans , but the legacy was stolen
Its Firm thing , generally gleam
wrote the theme on how to sell million
While you crabs is mad at your promotion team
roll with the nicest Fox
Black ice , pushing Benz without license
Gear tight as vice grips , Nas got 19 wifies
Seven shiesty , nine of them piceses
Three white meats under tight cheese
Wilding , big links is heavy like bricks
That you throw on pit-bull necks while feeding em raw steak
Its core take , more cake
take the crown of the so called king of the town and lock it down
Africa must wake up , the sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring , may better day come
Yesterday we were kings , can you tell me young ones
Who are we today ?
Yeah , now

The black oasis , Ancient Africa the sacred
The sleeping giant , science , art is your creation
dreamed that we could visit old Kemet
Your history is too complex and rigid for some Western critics
They want the whole subject diminished
But Africas the origin of all the worlds religions
We praise bridges that carried us over
The battle fronts of Sudanic soldiers , the task put before us
( Do you hear me now ? )


Who are we today ? The slums , diseases , AIDS
We need that all to fade , we cannot be afraid
So who are we today ?
We are the morning after , the makeshift youth
The slaveship captured , our diaspora is the final chapter
The ancestral lineage built pyramids
Americas first immigrants , the kings and daughters from Nile waters
The first architect , the first philosophers
Astronomers , the first prophets and the doctors were us , us

Now can we all pray ?
Each in his own way
Teaching and learning
We can work it out
Well have warm bed
Well have some warm bread
Shelter from the storm dread
And we can work it out
Mother nature feeds all
In fameine and drought
And though selfish in ways , not to share is out
Whats tree without root ?
Lion without tooth ?
lie without truth ?
You hear me out !

[ Chorus x2 , but the second one is :
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
What tomorrow may bring
May some more love come
Yesterday we were kings
tell ya young bloods
The world is yours today . . . ]

Dadyahow daali waayey , nabada diideen
Oo ninkii doortay dinta , waadinka dillee
Oo dal markii ladhiso , waadinka dunshee
Oo daacad ninkii damcay , waadinka dooxee
Oh ye people restless in the refusal of peace
And when man chooses religion , arent you the ones to kill him ?
And when country is built , arent you the ones to tear it down ?
And when one attempts to tell the truth , arent you the ones to cut him down ?


We want to thank yall , everybody out there
This is Nas , Damian Marley
Distant Relatives
Were all distant relatives , no matter where you from , where you live
How near or far

So thats why we came together one of the reasons
Why myself and Damian came together
Cause we all come from one place , and thats Africa
Thats right , you too . And you

So to all my distant relatives , lets take it back home !

You wanna stress on how used to play , thats how play
Nas : But , yo , they takin us into this next millenium , right now

Yeah its like wakin up from bad dream
( America )
Just to figure out you wasnt dreamin in the first place

If all saw was gangsters comin up as youngster
Pussy and money the only language clung ta
Claim ta mold myself up to become one
Aint ya happy chose rap Im monster
Streets deceiving they cant believe my achievements
Cultural strata personas that of non-needer
Because dont need nada except for prada beaver
For cold winters tattoos got my summers sleeveless
To my gs on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums come up phoenix caked up
Tryna take what Im eatin came up dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this savvy mouth
Wild hardly mans man who woulda knew
The beach houses and wild parties
Jezebels and stella mccartneys
For years all that how could not be dead ?
This old german said was thug with notty head
Looked at my benz and called that nazi sled
With face like he wonder where got my bread
Probably all these stones he see
From my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme my stories is
Im from the home of the thieves

America pay attention
( america )
Wake up this is not what you think it is
( america )
America pay attention
( america )
This is not what you think it is

Blessed the lord is he gotta be
Whos the god of suckers and snitches the economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe blew death kiss to Fidel Castro
Hed want me to spit this
Only the strong survive Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all can see
White cop acquitted for murder black cop cop plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers athletes and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances trends and fashion ?
But when it comes to residuals they look past us
Woven into the fabric they cant stand us
Even in white tees blue jeans and red bandannas

America pay attention
( america )
Wake up this is not what you think it is
( america )
America pay attention
( america )
This is not what you think it is
America
( america this is not what you think it is )

Assassinations diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people built new nation
Involuntary labor took knife split woman naval
Took her premature baby let her man see you rape her
If could travel to the 1700s
Id push wheelbarrow full of dynamite through your covenant
Love to sit in on the senate and tell the whole government
Yall dont treat women fair she read about herself in the bible
Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her with an apron like bring me my dinner dear
Shes the nigger here aint we in the free world ?
Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls
Barbarity Im in the double-R casually
Bugging how made it out the hood dazzle me
How far we really from third world savagery
When the empire fall imagine how crazy thatll be

Yeah , check it , uh
Spot build-rocker , lil papa killed Hoffa
Beard lil longer , feel strong and Ill stop ya
Drill sergeant , still thorough , wheelbarrows of distilled vodka
Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer
Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs , but they liars
Vote fo who now ? Youre red , white and blue ?
Im American too , but aint with the presidents crew
What you peddlin and who you peddlin to ?
You aint got the ghetto with you
Tryna lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse
Talkin bout + Rap the Vote + , you aint thought about
The black vote mean nathan , who you gonna elect
Satan or Satan ? In the hood nothin is changin , uh
We aint got no choices who to choose
Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices
And end Hip-Hop , they some hypocrites
Condoleeza Rice dont really get this chick
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools
About poor children , then she gotta prove that she
Aint just another coon Uncle Tom fool
Like these MCs , gotta give em the rules
Lie to the youth , Uncle Tom you confused
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community noose
Need truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry
On Kerry nuts , he look at you like monkey
You MCs on that old slavery path
The Bushsll look at yo ass and laugh
See , its all about community , lets help ourselves
Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells
Its our turn , its bout time we win
Need somebody from the hood as my councilman , uh

Yeah think about this every day , thats the American Way , shit
( Repeat x4 )

Up in the steam room chillin , exfoliating the skin
Israeli men conversatin on ends , probably businessmen
sense good taste , and they watch us , the spots an expensive place
Manhattan New York , Im tryna keep steamin
Its good for the lungs , had plans for the evening
This man leans in , his boys laughing
Now Im the spokesperson for Black men , this always happens
Says , " Since all Black women care about is who got dough
And all we do is call them either bitch or Black ho "
say first brotha you aint gotta be that cold
Since you ignorant , Imma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trumps pimping spree
Most woman who love Giovanni or Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame , not the dames
Its man-made game , in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures , Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve the Hermes purse
Matter fact , Im about to go shopping with my dime
Catch you cowards the next time , the next rhyme , uh


dont care about the runaways
dont care about whos gay
dont care about dying of AIDS
But care if got paid
Who even cares about the president ?
think theyre making mistake
dont care about the hurricane
As long as my familys safe
dont care about the candidates
They burnt this country to bits
Yeah think about this everyday , thats the American Way ( Nas : Uh )

Can we make change
You know its not overnight
Lets start the fight ( Nas : And ya dont stop , uh )
Can we make change
You know its not overnight
Lets start the fight ( Nas : Yeah )
Yeah think about this everyday , thats the American Way

* Sample * Nas : Nas is rebel to America !
walk the blocks like whatever god , my message to yall feds
Who desperate to arrest us young , benevolent hardheads
Abercrombie & Fitch rockin , wrist glistenin marksman
Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed
The project logic is still salute the dead , Glocks spit
Pour some juice out for those in Manchester , Beaumount
Otisville , Lewisberg , Fort Dix , Fort Worth , Oakdale
Every fed jail where all my dawgs lurk
War hurts much to gain til the day we all say
May your pain be champagne then we all blaze away
At our enemies , may they die easily
Long as they perish forevers what freedom means to me
Blowin greenery , growing eager to see evil things
Thrown away , zonin grey , GT , Diesel jeans
Airs and Chucks , solitaires , stones with the rarest cuts
On some Pretty Tone shit , haircut looks airbrushed
And theyre aware of us though
And we dont give flyin 747 fuck though
Stayin on my hus-tle
* beat change *

message to those who trapped us up , from federal guys who backed them up
We never will die , we black and tough , lead in your eye , we strapped to bust
Half of us been locked up inside the beast , look at the time we see
Brooklyn to Compton streets , Queens , even the Congo needs dreams
Our bullets and triggers our enemies pullin on innocent women and children
It wasnt no ghetto killers who mixed up the coke and put guns in our buildings
But Im not gon cry , and Im not gon just stand and watch you die
Imma pass you . , Imma grab your hand come on lets ride
message to those who killed the king , who murdered the Christ
The same regime , what God has built you never can break
What God has loved you never can hate , man makes rules and laws
You just ruthless dog , your kennel is waiting
You devils will run back into the caves you came from
Whenever that day comes , forty-acres , plantations , see every race won
Sincerely yours , Streets Disciple , revelations
First see flashin light , then on my own
hear nothin , the smell of fire in brimstone
feel hundreds arms grabbin me , fallin down the hole
Is it because there is no Gravity my body leaves my Soul
Is the Devil mad at me ? will go to Hell ?
Or is it Heaven that awaits me ? , is too early to tell
Is it now that Im to be judged ?
Will face thee bright tunnel warm lights ?
Will embrace me before force takes me
Like Im movin through high winds
See my self in baby carriages , relatives and friends
Things manifest , kings from every planets rest here
Beams of light hear the voice of the Nazareth near

You Amongst Kings from both far near land
Made in my image son of God son of man
You came in the spirit for am that am
Father of all worlds Fallen Angel and the Lamb

Seen my body layin down in the ground
It was painless , didnt feel thing
Shots ring felt the anxious to get up and run
was atheist , committed Suicide
wish could erase this shit
seen new life before the Christ
He created night & day , the sun & moon
From the virgin womans womb
We lookin down at my body , emergency room
Doctors frownin at me surgical performs , Im doomed
Its my day of judgment , eternal peace & fire
Far past the stars far past the Orion
asked that you forgive father , was tryin
Many thrones in the light but only ones truly shinin


Faster then the blinkin eye , is the master and
Face to face ( uh ) fightin my case so we debate ( where ? )
Countin all my sins ( ok ) , where do we begin
When stabbed the man in the train station or drunk gin
When grabbed the man let the shells hit him from the Mac 10
It was all retaliation , ( from what ? ) from way back then
Now got the black Benz ( and ) trips from Aspen ( and )
Disney World for my little girl and Im askin
You would recognize all the good deeds Im worth ( Dear God )
Send me on trip God please the Earth
So can deliver thou want it , stop playin
He gave me life , screamed out loud that " Am . . . "
( Nas . . . Nastradamus )

And saw another mighty angel come down from Heaven ( Am )
Clothe wit the cloud ( Nastradamus )
And the rainbow was upon his head as Crown ( Am )
And his face was lit as were the Sun ( Am )
And his feet as pillars of fire ( Nastradamus )
And his name was Nastradamus ( Am )
( Am Nastradamus )

What the hell . . . what the hell . . .

What the hell . . . what the hell . . .


People know me on these streets player , aint new
Lookin at me all funny , while Im countin my money
Suprise , what do is already legalized
Analyze what toss across , aint no love lost

Fo sure , everythings for dough now
Flow , you gotta pay little more now
Its platinum , now days we put the gold down
We stepped it up , yall dont ever want showdown
Get wetted up by the sleeve that leave the Bezzle out
Yall dont like it ? Sue me , fuck Ill settle out
Ghettod out in the vehicle Bent
These days mellowed out , see success make fella content
Uh-huh , you know , this rap star , Papi Chulo
Jay-Z , Hugo , of course player you lost player
know you rappers wanna see me fail
But quick to see 600SEL V-Twelve
Live wit it , yall got dough to get get it
got mine , your little bit of money couldnt stop mine
Your block time , too hot , too many hands in your pie
Seventy thirty , the nigga you work for work for me
Bottom line

People know me on these streets and the towns been through
Lookin at me , stay focused , Im givin em straight poker suprise
What do is already legalized
Analyze how floss of course , aint no love lost

We be the Bronx to BKlyn , togethor we about ton or better
On the way in , we rhyme related , very underestimated
Thats why Im winnin in this world of sins
Steady grinnin , money boss spendin
Distant from dirty women , Lord , Im quite influencial
Spiritualy and mental , what you into done been through
Preachin my words and dont know what you owe
It shows you wanna be me , but wont show it
Aint nothin changed , but players , the game remains the same
had ten year run , hey cant complain
Took the next step see , from Coke to Pepsi
From the bx weed , ridin the south beach on jet-ski
Play to survive , you aint live you just livin
You breathin good one , but where Im from , yall forbidden
Come around , bad decision , you rather be in prison
Aint no duckin what Im deliverin wont be forgivin in
Layin there shiverin , half the night
You gotta walk toward the light , everything is aiight
make sure everything you endure stays tight
Big ( * boom * ) Lord Tariq , Jay-Z , outta sight


spend nights on corners , see the crack , cop my first Mac
No longer scared to pump what yall pump , now burst back
It hurts that , dont seem . . . . can make my purse fat
Without the benefits of doubt , hit the hearst black
But curse that , tryin to see Nas was your worst match
Blowin like Tahitii , throw off NYPD
Am greedy ? Like Amin Idi see me
In fly Salinii gimme frames in the beanie
flip my loot twice week on my most trifest streets
You got no right to eat by the laws of life you keep
Aint no love lost , none taken , none givin
Stressin how Im livin it , thinkin when my loot first came
Look what did with it , bought my click glaciers
And pagers , rollin ten deep to Las Vegas
Copped live croc , chopped it up , hit my block off
Wit gators , feedin peoples , from the bridge to Dequatas
But now , two years five months and 30 days later
still put out the street flavor
But watch that kid right there , bulge in his night wear
Awoke me up the ways used to be in my heist years
Bubble eye small fry loaded four five
Just thirstin for some person with shine to just walk by
Now that can see the 360 , now that its me thats jiggy
Them cooly heads they wanna stick me , whoa

Now greetings to the world
And to the intelligence of mankind
Is what makes us special among all other species
Everything is beautiful if found congregation before it

Before the horse saddle there was camel

Chief before sarge , or lieutenant
Village elders before the senate
Used to sail the seas before the compass was invented
Ancient people spoke free , they didnt need 1st amendment

Im pregnant , dont know who the dad is
Im happy , but this shits the saddest
Im maintaining , still keeping my status
Fuck what you haters say , my ass is still the fattest
Roll with the baddest , my girls in Gucci glasses
How could you pass this ? Your loss
But aint tripping Im still the boss
wont be another black girl lost
Lost , lost , lost , lost , Lost , lost

Brown and beautiful , black and stunning , light and delicious
Chocolate colored strawberry kisses and cherry lipstick
Very mystic , bald stitches her wig
Kinky curly and dread , goddess gon grant my wishes
Tantalizing touches , succulent skin , we should wed
Start off broke then stay together til we make it big
My queen is english , Sojourner Truth , could learn from you
Never Ike Turner you , but look what you turn and do like
Get out of order , youre not supporter of my dream
Rich girl fantasy schemes , good man she needs
But she young and she speeding , honey now , whats the reason ?
You just met this nigga , think you owe him fucking threesome
So you lustin to have baby by Denver Nugget
You dont love him , you want security , baby , your bugging
Financial liberty youre after , its how you live
But the blood test shows its not even his kid


Chanel bags , everything
She shopping every time she gets wedding ring
This her 3rd marriage , carats
Brand new Jag , deserves to have it
Temptation , she cant let go her dirty habits
Mid 30s , spendin dough at Magic
Shes dancin , romancin , shes up at Manson
She fucks all my mans , and they pop the magnums
So now what you gonna do , the morning-after pill is way overdue
Posed to get married , now you embarassed
Who does this kid belong to ?
Promiscuous , cuz she got touched by step-dad , sex at
Such young age , if you was virgin , Id get mad
Sick society , blaming yourself so wrong
highly respect you , bet that , strong , intelligent
This song aint to poke fun of you , to get laughs
just love you , really love you
Here for you , wanna trust you
Wanna cuff you , be my lady
But first , gotta see the baby


Ladies , believe in you
We gotta stop this craziness out here , though
We gotta get right
Because when we both get right , we both take flight
Us real men need you , for real
Hey yo Jason
Say somethin to her
Holla at her
got one question
How do you fit all that in them jeans ?
You know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle wiggle wiggle
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
Just little bit

Patty cake patty cake with no hands
Got me in this club , making wedding plans
If take pictures while you do your dance
could make you famous on Instagram

Hot damn it , your booty like two planets
Go ahead , and go ham sandwich
Woah cant stand it
Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt


Cadillac Cadillac , pop that trunk
Lets take shot , Alley oop that donk
Tired of working that nine to five
Oh , baby let me come and change your life

( Wiggle wiggle wiggle )
( Shake it shake it girl )
( Little bit , little bit , little bit )

Shake what your mamma gave you , misbehave you
just wanna strip you , dip you , flip you , bubble bathe you
What they do
Taste my raindrops , boo ?
Now what youre willing , what you wanting , what you may do
Completely separated til deeply penetrate it
Then take it out and wipe it off
Eat it , ate it , love it , hate it
Overstated , underrated , everywhere been
Can you wiggle wiggle for the D-O double again ?

Come on baby , turn around
Youre star , girl , take bow
Its just one thing thats killing me
How do you fit that in them jeans ?


Now make it clap ( wiggle wiggle wiggle ) ( x4 )
Damn baby , you got bright future behind you

, , and to the
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr . Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
( Cause you know were about to rip shit up )
Give me the microphone first so can bust like bubble
Compton and Long Beach together , now you know you in trouble
Aint nothing but thang , baby
Two loced out niggas so were crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please dont try to fade this
But um , back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected , so Imma let em understand
From young Gs perspective
And before me dig out bitch have to find contraceptive
You never know , she could be earning her man
And learning her man and at the same time burning her man
Now you know aint with that shit , Lieutenant
Aint no pussy good enough to get burnt while Im up in it ( Yeah )
And thats realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how feel
Well , if its good enough to get broke off proper chunk
Ill take small piece of some of that funky stuff

Its like this and like that and like this and uh
Its like that and like this and like that and uh
Its like this and like that and like this and uh
Dre , creep to the mic like phantom

Well Im peeping and Im creeping and Im creep-in
But damn near got caught , cause my beeper kept beeping
Now its time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back , relax and strap on your seat belt
You never been on ride like this before
With producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that kick
You know and know , flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection , the selection
Symbolizes dope , take toke but dont choke
If you do , youll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do


And who gives fuck about those
So just chill , til the next episode

Falling back on that ass , with hellafied gangsta lean
Getting funky on the mic like old batch of collard greens
Its the capital , oh yes Im fresh , double-O
double , double , ya see
Showing much flex when its time to wreck mic
Pimping hoes and clocking grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah , and it dont quit
think they in the mood for some mothafuckin shit
Hell yeah so Dre ( whattup Dogg )
Gotta give them what they want ( whats that , )
We gotta break em off something ( hell yeah )
And its gotta be bumping , City of Compton

Is where it takes place so , when asked , your attention
Mobbing like motherfucker but aint lynching
Dropping the funky shit thats making the sucker niggas mumble
When Im on the mic , its like cookie : they all crumble
Try to get close , and your assll get smacked
My motherfuckin homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip , cause if slip then Im slipping
But if got my Nina then you know Im straight tripping
And Imma continue to put the rap down , put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit , Ill have to put the smack down
Yeah and you dont stop
told you Im just like clock when tick and tock
But Im never off , always on to the break of dawn
C-O M-P T-O and the city they call Long Beach
Putting the shit together
Like my nigga . . . , " No One Can Do it Better "

Hold up , hold up
bet you thinking that we dead
Hold up , hold up

Hold up , hold up
Mama whats them words you said ?
Hold up , hold up
Why you make us think youre dead ?

( 6X ) Oh they , oh they
Think we dead

Hold up , hold up
Me and Dilla bout to blow some trees
Hold up , pass to Austin and to Freddie Mercury
Dont need nobody , we bouncin on that Astral Plane
Hold up , hold up

( Thats cause youre dead )

( Snoop Dogg )
Nickel plated nine
Bang bang blow your mind
Beep beep flatline
Gotta get yours , been had mine
Hold my hand , laying in the bed
Family crying , they think he dead
No jokes no hoax
Felt his palm , he had no pulse
Couldve been the drank , it mightve been the smoke
In light of all that he was considered dope
And now Im left to keep you strong
And kept you Flying Lotus and step too
You cant run , just gonna get you
was live when met you
Now this seems to upset you
This what the shit gon get you : Death

Yeah nigga
Im still fucking with ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R , 99 nigga
Guess whos back
Still doing that shit huh Dre ?
( Oh for sho , check me out )

Its still Dre Day nigga , AK nigga
Though Ive grown lot , cant keep it home lot
Cause when frequent the spots that Im known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when Im on the block
Ladies they pay homage , but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga ?
My last album was The Chronic ( nigga )
They want to know if he still got it
They say raps changed
They wanna know how feel about it
( If you aint up on thangs )
Dr . Dre is the name
Im ahead of my game
Still puffing my leafs
Still fuck with the beats , still not loving police
Still rock my khakis with cuff and crease
Still got love for the streets , repping 213 ( for life )
Still the beats bang , still doing my thang
Since left aint too much changed , still

Im representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them corners in them lo-los , girl
( Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And still got love for the streets , its the D-R ( x2 ) )

Since the last time you heard from me lost some friends
Well , hell , me and Snoop , we dippin again
Kept my ear to the streets , signed Eminem
Hes triple platinum , doing 50 week
Still , stay close to the heat
And even when was close to defeat , rose to my feet
My lifes like soundtrack wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed , smoke til sleep
Wake up in the . . , compose beat
bring the fire til youre soaking in your seat
Its not fluke , its been tried , Im the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin Cru
Im still at it
After-mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets , sticky green , and bad traffic
dip through then get skin , D-R


It aint nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for yall to vibe with
Whether youre cooling on the corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack , play this track
Im representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still ( Hitting them corners on the lo-los girl )
Ill break your neck , damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back ( So if you aint up on thangs )
Dr . Dre be the name still running the game
Still , got it wrapped like mummy
Still aint tripping , love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood , take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs , no more living hard
Barbeques every day , driving fancy cars
Still gon get mine regardless


Right back up in ya mothafuckin ass , 9-5 plus four pennies !
Add that shit up , D-R right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your dog , no stress , no seeds , no stems , no sticks !
Some of that real sticky icky icky , ooh wee !

Eyes open , focus , scoping out the scene
Watch the gangsta haters close cos they worse than dope fiends

And keep the Doggystyle hottest thing out the LB

Oh yes Im fresh till expire from existence

To supply you wit what you need , no room for greed
Better go around and when it come to you

Respect the game and the game will respect you back
Game is life , life is struggle
Without the coastal juggle

Or will you be man and pick up all the pieces
And put it back together and remain tougher than leather

Cause its the first time in long time ( right )
Reminiscing about the Fresh Fest back in 85
When the dubs and the San Diegs used to hoo ride
On motherfuckers like it was the thing to do
Eighty-five , eighty-fo , eight-tre , and year eighty-two ( eighty-two )
You know what the fuck Im talking about
After party on the lake at the big homies house
And bet nobody bring motherfucking gun
Cause everybody in the houses from two-one . . .

Tray Deee :
Twenty-first street , burst street , where it all started
And you know East Side , Long Beach , the hardest
Niggas coming realer than The Real McCoy
So step with your rap and we bring the noise

Dice in the back if ya wanna get your riches
No snitches allowed inside the crowd
Cause this is the thang , East Side . . . brang
In to have some fun represent two-one
And bet nobody bring mothafucking gun and . . .

Snoop :

Tatatata . . . . .

Snoop ( Tray ) :
If ya bring strap , then ya have to trip

We got meat to eat , ( freaks to meet )
And chronic we can smoke on , ( and forever get loc on )
Strolling through the Park one day
Puffing on fat ass , with my homie named Tray
Deee tryin to see if we could put this LBC thing
Back together like it was supposed to see

Tray :
Cause ya know Im down with ya to make em get the picture
And if have to sit ya down then spit ya
Game from the heart , came from the start
See was regulating when Cragars was the Daytons

Snoop :
Nigga let me interact with my black croaker sacks *
And gray golf hat tilted to the back ( whats up ? )
Ditchin Sunday school to get pack of Now and Laters
While Im rolling with the Steelers and killin with the raiders

Tray :
And when we bang with the Saints then we aint no joke
Come around from outta bounds and we goes for broke

Snoop :
Now were breaking em up ( hmm hmm ) , shaking em up ( yeah )
And just for second were waking em up
( continue ) Giving up game on this tight ass beat
With small dedication to two-one street
Sometimes feel lost like runaway , read over the dire
Reap while stay gettin Richard like Pryor
Need to put the gun away cause got priors
Its hard to stay rollin when the world full of riders
Bullet tip on fire , flyin down sunset
Motivated to win , like aint won yet
Think shit over ? Hell naw aint done yet
L-B see yall prayin that fall
Tonight its goin down like free fall
Chevy bouncin up and down like fuckin see-saw
Trippin off hate , no Hee-Haw
All blacks locs on the loc actin like dont see yall
Doing that shit to demean Dogg
But when bring it to you , you be like " What you mean Dogg ? "
Then we go back and forth , like its ping-pong
Knowin should just ring ya bell , ding dong !
But thats one thing about this shit partner
Every move is so watched by these rich boxers
So why should lose all my rich sponsors ?
Im gone then you suddenly hip-hoppin ?
Sheeit , sip the gin then Im in the wind
Pop beam like &
So strong yet nigga thin
Rappers stay sayin Slim so Shady but aint talkin Eminem
So fuck you , him , and him
was gangbangin befo nigga entered in
No facade , went from the yard
To three-car garage to , instant menage its
Vintage , relentless , mean this , promise
No Suge , No Dre , Ida did this regardless
And thats what Im supposed to think
Flinch at me like Im supposed to blink
Motherfucker this Crip still , hard to swallow like big pill
Pushin 40s still big deal
Ponytail still swangin , hair still braided
Laker to Clipper wont be faded
Nigga ! So buzz on that shit
Backflip back to plaque shit
Blue red white to black shit , but for the green
send whole motherfuckin team to clap shit
React to mack shit , problem , terrorist
Fuck this rap shit !

Shots fired
Suspect down
Request EMT immediately
Aint nothin but gangsta party
Ahh shit , you done fucked up now
You done put two of Americas most wanted in the same
Motherfuckin place at the same motherfuckin time
Yall niggas about to feel this
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin condoms
Have one on us aight

Picture perfect , paint perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision , my intentions to get richer
With the S-N double-O , Dogg my fuckin homie
Youse cold-ass nigga on them hogs

Sho nuff
keep my hand on my gun , cause they got me on the run
Now Im back in the courtroom waitin on the outcome
Free 2Pac is all thats on niggas mind
But at the same time it seems , they tryin to take mine
So Imma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together Million March for some gangsta shit

So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down , the shits about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
Im losin my religion
Im vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game , but you got the rules missing
Niggas be actin like they savage , they out to get the cabbage
Ive got nothin but love for my niggas living lavish

Ive got pit named , she Nigerina
Ive got house out in the hills right next to Chino
And . . . think Ive got black Bimmer
But my dreams to own fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel , and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you baby-bubba
You see , this is for the Gs and the keys , motherfucker

Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest , two of the best from the westside
And can make you famous
Niggas been dyin for years so how could they blame us
live in fear of felony
never stop bailin these
Motherfuckin Gs
If you got it better flaunt it
Another warrant for of Americas most wanted

Aint nothin but gangsta party
It aint nothin but motherfucking gangsta party

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny , release me to the streets
And keep whatevers left of me
Jealousy is misery , suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me , bust and flee
" These niggas must be crazy , what ? "
There aint no mercy , motherfuckers who cant fade the thugs
You thought it was but it wasnt , now disappear
Bow down in the presence of boss player

Its like Cuz / Blood gang-bangin
Everybody in the party doin dope-slangin
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin your job every day
And then you work so hard til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you about life and about the way it is
You see , we live by the gun , so we die by the guns , kids

They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now gotta throw away
Floating in the black Benz , trying to do show day
They wonder how live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers , so we made it
No answers to questions , Im trying to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me , eternally the most wanted


When pull up people so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just dont go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause can
These hoes know just who am
Them niggas talking it but they just dont go harder than us

Uh , This ones for the gs , all black chucks on the cuffs on my jeans
King size papers stuffed full of trees , be with the boss dawg yall fuck niggas fleas
Now they say Im hot hundred something degrees , taking pictures with young nigga cheese
Remember days homey , aint had thing
Now Im hopping off the plane putting roaches on the wing
And my hoes like queens , but we smoke like kings
Jewelery froze like bling , money come fast youre slow like lean
Third period , Showing up last with late note blowing grey smoke

When pull up people so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just dont go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause can
These hoes know just who am
Them niggas talking it but they just dont go harder than us

We blow to the middle of the day
Wiz say dawg put little in the jay
Hey , why not ? Not why ?
We fly , we ride , she high , he high , we high
Fuck it , everybody to the library
Got new batch , some blue , boo-berry
Stuck in the hallway , we pass he say dog he just smoke all day
Its mind game , like the lean seen to keep migranes
Ritchie Valens , and bitch Im freaking limeade
Im so lifted , like parachute
My grass , they off they all Ferris Beuller
Slip away , dip away , almost had to throw zip away
But fuck that , this the taylor gang , what you want dog Shit Im on everythang

Bitches will be bitches as smash in the Chevy

It all goes back , to 85
When start gettin pussy every day of my life
It really didnt matter what the bitch look like
remember one night , after the Sugar Ray fight
Wouldnt you believe it , Dogg like retriever
went up in this big fat bitch named Treva
She had best friend with titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her , yessir
Aint no pressure , later that semester
She put me down with her homegirl name Tanisha
She was so vicious , lips so luscious
Suck nigga dick and have it shinin like some dishes
Patricia , Patricia , she love the way stick her

Big bucks , no whammies
had to meet this white bitch , her name was Tammy
She lived in the Valley , she couldnt understand me
But she let me dig out , her homegirl named Brandi
Now Brandi was cute little thick bitch
She moved to the hood from the 2-oh
She brought some new tricks , flippin them squirrels
And the pearls , and turnin out the neighborhood little girls
Hmm , and seen that , so peep the game
So put her down , bottom bitch on my team
And we began makin , breakin bitches takin
Whatever we want , see she want with the fakin

And crack the little bitch , yeah she Jamaican
Time and time again she would bring me bud
And let me beat it up , listenin to " One Love "

From the motherfuckin president yall
He said , " Snoop Dogg , how could fuck bitch
And make her suck dick and not get caught for the fuck of it ? "

Went up in his sister , behind the garage

When yall was tryin to hump , was teachin them to suck dick
Always tryin to go up in ho

Little somethin for my godson Elijah
And little girl named Corinne

Some say the blacker the berry , the sweeter the juice
say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
give holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares , if dont nobody else care
And , know they like to beat you down lot
When you come around the block , brothers clown lot
But please dont cry , dry your eyes , never let up
Forgive but dont forget , girl , keep your head up
And when he tells you you aint nothin , dont believe him
And if he cant learn to love you , you should leave him
Cause sister , you dont need him
And aint tryin to gas ya up , just call em how see em
You know what makes me unhappy
When brothers make babies , and leave young mother to be pappy
And since we all came from woman
Got our name from woman and our game from woman
wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women , do we hate our women
think its time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women , be real to our women
And if we dont well have race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since man cant make one
He has no right to tell woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
know youre fed up ladies , but keep your head up

Keep ya head up , ooh , child , things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up , ooh , child , thingsll get brighter

Aiyyo , remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didnt seem so tough
And though we had it rough , we always had enough
huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had smoke or two
And realize Momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how Id rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
Im tryin to make dollar out of fifteen cents
Its hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems Im headin for the pen
try to find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
Its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rainll never let up
try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
You know its funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but cant feed the poor
Say there aint no hope for the youth and the truth is
It aint no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
blame my mother for turning my brother into crack baby
We aint meant to survive cause its setup
And even though youre fed up
Huh , ya got to keep your head up


And uh , to all the ladies havin babies on they own
know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
Daddys long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids , even if nobody else want em
Cause think we can make it , in fact , Im sure
And if you fall , stand tall and come back for more
Cause aint nothin worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy dont love him no mo
You cant complain you was dealt this
Hell of hand without man , feelin helpless
Because theres too many things for you to deal with
Dyin inside , but outside youre looking fearless
While tears is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things dont fall down this week
Cause if it did , you couldnt take it , and dont blame me
was given this world didnt make it
And now my sons gettin older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
Im still tryin to hold on to surviving friends
And its crazy , it seems itll never let up , but
Please , you got to keep your head up
see no changes , wake up in the morning and ask myself :
" Is life worth living ? Should blast myself ? "
Im tired of being poor and , even worse , Im black
My stomach hurts so Im looking for purse to snatch
Cops give damn about negro
Pull the trigger , kill nigga , hes hero
" Give the crack to the kids : who the hell cares ?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare ! "
First ship em dope and let em deal to brothers
Give em guns , step back , watch em kill each other
" Its time to fight back , " thats what Huey said
Two shots in the dark , now Hueys dead
got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start making changes
Learn to see me as brother instead of two distant strangers
And thats how its supposed to be
How can the Devil take brother if hes close to me ?
Id love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change . . . and thats the way it is

Thats just the way it is
Thingsll never be the same
Thats just the way it is
Aww yeah

see no changes , all see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under , wonder what it takes to make this
One better place , lets erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people , theyll be acting right
Cause both Black and White are smoking crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real , time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We aint ready to see black president
It aint secret , dont conceal the fact :
The penitentiarys packed , and its filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you staying in the dope game
Now tell me , whats mother to do ?
Being real dont appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
" made today " but you made it in sleazy way
Selling crack to the kids , " gotta get paid ! "
Well hey , but thats the way it is


We gotta make change
Its time for us as people to start making some changes
Lets change the way we eat , lets change the way we live
And lets change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasnt working so its on us to do
What we gotta do to survive

And still see no changes , cant brother get little peace
Its war on the streets and war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got war on drugs so the police can bother me
And aint never did crime aint have to do
But now Im back with the facts giving it back to you
Dont let em jack you up , back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they " cant touch this "
dont trust this , when they try to rush bust this
Thats the sound of my tool
You say it aint cool , my mama didnt raise no fool
And as long as stay black , gotta stay strapped
And never get to lay back
Cause always got to worry bout the payback
Some buck that roughed up way back
Coming back after all these years
" Rat-a tat-tat tat-tat ! " Thats the way it is


Some thingsll never change
Makaveli in this , Killuminati all through your body
Blows like 12-gauge shotty , feel me
And God said he should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me ! Eat my flesh , flesh of my flesh

Come with me
Hail Mary nigga , run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die

aint killer , but dont push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded , wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down , pray to God , hoping that hes listening
Seeing niggas coming for me , through my diamonds , when they glistening
Now pay attention : bless me please Father , Im ghost
In these killing fields , Hail Mary , catch me if go
Lets go deep inside the solitary mind of madman
Screams , in the dark , evil lurks
Enemies , see me flee
Activate my hate , let it break to the flame
Set trip , empty out my clip ; never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck , niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit , plus
Mama told me never stop until bust nut
Fuck the world if they cant adjust , its just as well , Hail Mary


Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wasting
Instutionalized , live my life product made to crumble
But too hardened for smile , were too crazy to be humble : we ballin
Catch me father please , cause Im fallin in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy hear ya callin , can get some more ?
Hell , til reach Hell , aint scared
Mama checking in my bedroom , aint there
got head with no screws in it , what can do ?
One life to live but got nothing to lose
Just me and you on one way trip to prison
Selling drugs , we all wrapped up in this living life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doing their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights , Ill be there in the dark
Thugging eternal through my heart : now Hail Mary nigga


They got APB out on my thug family
Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now , walk around half dead
Head down , K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai chronic
Mixed in , now Im twisted , blistered and high
Visions of me : thug-living , getting me by
Forever live , and multiply , survived by thugs
When die they wont cry unless they coming with slugs

Peep the whole scene and whatevers going on around me
Brain kind of cloudy , smoked out , feeling rowdy
Ready to wet the party up , and whoever and that mothafucka
Nasty new street slugger , my heat seeks suckers
On the regular , mashing in stolen Black Ac Integra
Cocked back , 60 seconds til the draw thats when Im deadin ya feet first
Youve got nice Gat but my heats worse
From thug to preaching church , gave you love , now you eating dirt
Needing work and aint the nigga to put you on
Cause word is bond : when was broke had to hustle til dawn
Thats when sun came up , theres only one way up
Hold your head and stay up to all my niggas : get your pay and weight up

If its on then its on , we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on paper chase , can you relate ?
To this shit dont got be the shit gotta take
Dealing with fate , hoping God dont close the gate


Weve been traveling on this weary road
Sometimes life can take heavy load
But we ride , ride it like bullet , Hail Mary
We wont worry , everything well curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We wont worry , everything well curry
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We running from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty , Hail Mary

Westside . Outlawz . Makaveli the Don . Solo . Killuminati . The Days
When was young , me and my mama had beef
17 years old , kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time never thought Id see her face
Aint woman alive that could take my mamas place
Suspended from school and scared to go home , was fool
With the big boys breaking all the rules
shed tears with my baby sister , over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies , the same drama
When things went wrong wed blame mama
reminisce on the stress caused , it was hell
Huggin on my mama from jail cell
And whod think in elementary , hey
Id see the penitentiary one day ?
And running from the police , thats right
Mama catch me , put whoopin to my backside
And even as crack fiend , mama
You always was black queen , mama
finally understand
For woman it aint easy trying to raise man
You always was committed
poor single mother on welfare , tell me how you did it
Theres no way can pay you back , but the plan
Is to show you that understand
You are appreciated

Lady , dontcha know we love ya ? ( Dear mama )
Sweet lady , place no one above ya ( You are appreciated )
Sweet lady , dontcha know we love ya ?

Now aint nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
He passed away and didnt cry , cause my anger
Wouldnt let me feel for stranger
They say Im wrong and Im heartless , but all along
was looking for father he was gone
hung around with the thugs , and even though they sold drugs
They showed young brother love
moved out and started really hangin
needed money of my own so started slangin
aint guilty cause even though sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
love paying rent when the rents due
hope you got the diamond necklace that sent to you
Cause when was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And could see you coming home after work late
Youre in the kitchen trying to fix us hot plate
You just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough , youre alone
Youre trying to raise bad kids on your own
And theres no way can pay you back , but my plan
Is to show you that understand
You are appreciated


Pour out some liquor and reminisce , cause through the drama
can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that Im hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When was sick as little kid
To keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though act crazy
gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how feel
You never kept secret , always stayed real
And appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
wish could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night theres brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
Its struggle every day , gotta roll on
And theres no way can pay you back , but my plan
Is to show you that understand
You are appreciated
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of .
In the city of good ol Watts
In the city , the city of Compton
We keep it rockin

Now let me welcome everybody to the wild , wild West
state thats untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like slug to your chest
Pack vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find dance floor empty
And pimps be on mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making machines serving fiends
been in the game for 10 years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoons
Now its 95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining , looking like robbed Liberace
Its all good , from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-i aye


Shake , shake it , baby
Shake , shake it

Out on bail , fresh out of jail , California dreaming
Soon as step on the scene , Im hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of Westside player where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In . . we wearing Chucks not Ballys ( yeah , thats right )
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits , and ride is what we do
Flossing , but have caution : we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grands
Worldwide , let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like slow jam , its Westside
So you know the Row wont bow down to no man
Say what you say , but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of .
From Oakland to Sac-town , the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down
Give me love !


[ Dr . Dre ] South Central
[ 2Pac ] Uh , thats right
[ Dr . Dre ] Now make it shake


Shake it Cali
Uh , uh , West Coast
Uh , yeah , uh , uh , Long Beach in the house
Uh , yeah , Oaktown , Oakland definitely in the house

Inglewood always up to no good

Even Hollywood trying to get piece , baby

Sacramento , Sacramento where you at ?

Throw it up yall , throw it up , throw it up !

Lets show these fools how we do it over on this West Side
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga , theres Heaven for
Be lie , If told ya that never thought of death
My niggas , we the last ones left
But life goes on !

As bail through the empty halls
Breath stinkin in my jaws
Ring , ring , ring , quiet yall , incoming call
Plus this my homie from high school , hes getting by
Its time to bury another brotha nobody cry
Life as baller , alcohol and booty calls
We used to do them as adolescents , do you recall ?
Raised as Gs , loced out and blazed the weed
Get on the roof , lets get smoked out and blaze with me
in the morning and we still high assed out
Screamin " thug till die " before passed out
But now that youre gone , Im in the zone
Thinkin dont wanna die all alone
But now ya gone
And all got left are stinkin memories
love them niggas to death , Im drinkin Hennessey
While tryin ta make it last
drank 5th for that ass when you passed
Cause life goes on


Yeah nigga got the word as hell
Ya blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an
Time to prepare to do fed time , wont see parole
Imagine life as convict thats gettin old
Plus with the drama were lookin out for your babys mama
Taken risks , while keepin cheap tricks from gettin on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin on dumb hotties at yo parties
Me and you , no truer two
While scheming on hits and getting tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried
Rest nigga cause aint worried
Eyes blurry sayin goodbye at the cemetery
Tho memories fade
got your name tatted on my arm so we both ball till my dying days
Before say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace
Thug till die


Bury me smilin , with Gs in my pocket
Have party at my funeral , let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that used to know
From way before kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me paper and pen so can write about my life of sin
couple bottles of gin in case dont get in
Tell all my people Im Ridah
Nobody cries when we die , we outlaws , let me ride
Until get free , live my life in the fast lane , got police chasing me
To my niggas from old blocks from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor have toast for the homies
See we both gotta die but ya chose to go before me
And brothas miss ya while your gone
You left your nigga on his own
How long we mourn
Life goes on

Chorus * repeats to end *
( sung over repeating chorus )

Life goes on homie
Gone on , cause they passed away
Niggas doin life , niggas doin 50 and 60 years and shit
feel ya nigga , trust me , feel ya
You know what mean
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year nigga , life goes on
Were gonna clock now
Get money , evade bitches , evade tricks
Give players plenty space , and basically just represent for you baby
Next time you see your niggas , your gonna be on top nigga
Theyre gonna be like
" Goddamn , them niggas came up "
Thats right baby , life goes on
And we up out this bitch
Hey Kato , Mental , yall niggas make sure its poppin when we get up there
Dont front
Death Row , thats where motherfuckers is endin up

Dear Mama , Im caught up in this sickness
robbed my adversaries but slipped and left witness
Wonder if theyll catch me or will this nigga snitch
Should shoot his bitch or make the nigga rich
Dont wanna commit murder but damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while Im walkin and talkin behind my back
Im kind of schizophrenic ; Im in this shit to win it
Cause lifes Wheel of Fortune , heres my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops , who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin trigger happy , to let them suckers snatch me
Niggas gettin jealous , tryin to find my stash
Whip out the nine , now pull that dime out your ass
Peter picked pepper but can pick punk
Snatched him like bitch and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought was bluffin but swear Im nothin nice
Before take your life , first wrestle with these mics
listened to his screams , until he went insane
guess the little mice had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over , Im sentenced to the pen
Remember that little , bird , he snitched and told friend
Its trouble on my mind , Im with the old timers
And fuck five-O , blaow blaow , turn em into forty-niners

Bye bye , was never meant to live
Cant be positive , when the ghettos where you live
Bye bye , was never meant to be
Livin like thief , runnin through the streets
Bye bye , and got no place to go
Where they find me , 16 on Death Row

Dear mama , these cops dont understand me
turned to life of crime , cause came from broken family
My uncle used to touch me , never told you that
Scared what you might do , couldnt hold you back
kept it deep inside , done let it fuel my anger
Im down for all my homies , no mercy for stranger
The brother in my cell , is 16 as well
Its hard to adapt when youre black and youre trapped in living Hell
shouldnt have let him catch me
Instead of livin sad in jail coulda died free and happy
And my cellmates raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm , you can hear his asshole gettin torn
They made me an animal , cant sleep
Instead of countin sheep , niggas countin cannibals
And thats how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold , and your soul is your best friend
My mama prayed for me
Tell the Lord to make way for me , prepare any day for me ( why ? )
Cause when they come for me they find struggler
To the death take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
found my buddy hangin dead from rope , 16 on Death Row


Dear mama , they sentenced me to death
Todays my final day , Im countin every breath
Im bitter cause Im dyin , so much havent seen
know you never dreamed , your baby would be dead at 16
got beef with sick society that doesnt give shit
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preachers there for me
Hes crook with book , that mothafucka never cared for me
Hes only here to be sure
dont drop dime to God bout the crimes hes commitin on the poor
And how can these people judge me ?
They aint my peers and in all these years , they aint never love me
never got to be man , must be part of some big plan
To keep nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin mothafuckas
Steer clear of these Aryan mothafuckas
Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped , youre better off gettin shot up
Im convinced self-defense is the way
Please , stay strapped , pack gat every day
wish woulda known while was out there
Now Im straight headin for the chair


16 on Death Row
Its to all my partners in the penitentiaries
[ Hook : C-Bo ] ( 2X )
West side , its 187 on motherfucking hook
Niggas out of bounds should have shook
We bangin by the book
Got shot in the neck tryin to get away
And to vigi it aint nothin but gun play

HEEY !
Got some static for some niggas on the other side of town
Let my little cousin roll , hes rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin thug niggas ?
Used to love niggas , now plug niggas
And slug niggas , am wrong ?
Niggas makin songs , tryin to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed , in the West we trust
To the chest BUST ! Then we ride til the sun come

Castrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow

Vigilante and villain regime niggas come with steel guns
Get ready to sleep cause you tripped when you fuck with villain

You see , we live by the gun , so we die by the guns , kids

My nigga Dogg with me , eternally the most wanted


Ready nigga ? Ready for that raw dog shit nigga ?
Okay , Alright

But now Im back to let these niggas know just how

So everybody wanna smile , and raise they hands

Slicin motherfuckers now Im doing the joint

Bitches on my dick you know the hoes wanna ride me
And my other homies out here like Spike Lee
They got the camera on nigga guess they like me
But now Im bout to pass this motherfucker on
Cause this Tanqueray is getting hella strong


Uh , Uh
Money , hoes and clothes blunt smoke coming out
The nose is all nigga knows , flippin on foes , puttin tags on toes
Watchin the stash grow , clockin the cash flow , the neighborhood grave digger
Gettin paid so much all the bitches wanna see nigga , guessed they figured im
Paid wanna get laid or since got loot wanna knock boots , huh , rather beat
My dick then trick and if she dont suck then we dont fuck huh , rather lick buck drive
Fatass truck grab the nine two clips and run them up , yes , flex out the or benzs since
Wreck shit , what the fuck do you expect it , fly guy , well fuck it imma high guy from bed-stuy
Puttin the swellin on your eye and your nose even , when choke ya you stop breathin
And when police come , Im leavin
When was young , me and my mama had beef
17 years old , kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time never thought Id see her face
Aint woman alive that could take my mamas place
Suspended from school and scared to go home , was fool
With the big boys breaking all the rules
shed tears with my baby sister , over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies , the same drama
When things went wrong wed blame mama
reminisce on the stress caused , it was hell
Huggin on my mama from jail cell
And whod think in elementary , hey
Id see the penitentiary one day ?
And running from the police , thats right
Mama catch me , put whoopin to my backside
And even as crack fiend , mama
You always was black queen , mama
finally understand
For woman it aint easy trying to raise man
You always was committed
poor single mother on welfare , tell me how you did it
Theres no way can pay you back , but the plan
Is to show you that understand
You are appreciated

Lady , dontcha know we love ya ? ( Dear mama )
Sweet lady , place no one above ya ( You are appreciated )
Sweet lady , dontcha know we love ya ?

Now aint nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
He passed away and didnt cry , cause my anger
Wouldnt let me feel for stranger
They say Im wrong and Im heartless , but all along
was looking for father he was gone
hung around with the thugs , and even though they sold drugs
They showed young brother love
moved out and started really hangin
needed money of my own so started slangin
aint guilty cause even though sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
love paying rent when the rents due
hope you got the diamond necklace that sent to you
Cause when was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And could see you coming home after work late
Youre in the kitchen trying to fix us hot plate
You just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough , youre alone
Youre trying to raise bad kids on your own
And theres no way can pay you back , but my plan
Is to show you that understand
You are appreciated


Pour out some liquor and reminisce , cause through the drama
can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that Im hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When was sick as little kid
To keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though act crazy
gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how feel
You never kept secret , always stayed real
And appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
wish could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night theres brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
Its struggle every day , gotta roll on
And theres no way can pay you back , but my plan
Is to show you that understand
You are appreciated

Pumpin tapes from that nigga Breed and Pac

Still ride

* Chorus *

MC Breed :

Im cold-hearted fool

And wont be headed home if he falls apart
Conatact niggas like part time
When ride the beat
Aint no way to hide from the darkside
Man of many mens till the very end
And blend in and change my iden
Just to mix up with the game
They know me by the Breed and they dont know its my last name
Its mind over matter
dont mind , you dont matter
Pull Glock and watch the whole block scatter
And we can have us gat to gat talk
Do it old style and do back to back walk
Count to ten and say goodbye to your friends
And we can put the bull shit to an end
figure if he plays around he lays around
And hes motherfucker goner , call corner when Im around
Bodies are buried and found all around
And parish and charish and thoughts just to be true
Punk , fellas behave ya and it just might save ya
So guard your girl and pickup your pistol
Cause you cant get wit Breed the weed head lyrical nit wit
The shit wont change as long as Im alive
gotta survive and keep it tight

* Chorus *

Who hold , boulder , turn the gun controller
Started from punk now to be high roller
Youngest , reckless , crazy , disaster
Mac-11 blaster , and run faster
Than lot of cops cant be stopped till my head gets popped
lot of fuckin bodies will drop
Its disaster , Im coming for the blood splatter

Blowin em out the frame with no shame
Game tight , drop body then get out of sight
Count my loot after shoot , leave my kicks up and its
Something dont wanna do , somethin that never did

Nigga , go read the mothafuckin newspaper , you trick-ass nigga

How many broke-down rappers got some shit to say ?

Plus all day , puff weed till my eyes bleed red
Undercover tactics , leave my enemies dead
Check this , know you niggas got no love for me
But how the fuck your whole clique turn to thugs , homie ?
Like misdemeanors , its small thang
You niggas aint ready for war , let my balls hang
Bust it , took apart your whole crew , lack heart , aint concerned
bust at Bad Boy , Mobb Deep and murder The Firm
When you scream " Fake thugs , " who the fuck you mean ?
Get more cream than all of yall , nigga , fuck your team
Now Dre want to switch sides , tricks hide in war
Last year , shed tears , but dont cry no more
Plus Jay-Z tried to play me , wont last long
Go ask King Sun how it feel to have your ass gone
Listen Doo-Wop , dont get your shit knocked , you cant win
Tell em all to let the games begin , we havin war games

Yeah nigga , yall niggas cant fade this shit
Got shot times , got out of jail on bail
And sold million

Im self-made millionaire !
Thug livin , out of prison
Pistols in the air
( Background while Chorus :
Sold more records then all you trick muthafuckaz put together
More then the Firm , more then Bad Boy , murder Mobb Deep )

( 3rd time parallel : ) Now Im back to set the record straight
With my A-K , Im still the thug that you love to hate ( love to hate , love to hate )




First off , fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride , come equipped with game
You claim to be player but fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys , niggas fucked for life
Plus Puffy tryna see me , weak hearts rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior . . . . . some mark-ass bitches
We keep on coming while we running for your jewels
Steady gunning , keep on busting at them fools
You know the rules
Little Ceasar go ask you homie how Ill leave you
Cut your young ass up , leave you in pieces
Now be deceased
Little Kim , dont fuck around with real Gs
Quick to snatch your ugly ass off the streets
So fuck peace
Ill let them niggas know its on for life
So let the Westside ride the night
Bad Boys murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get your caps peeled
You know



( Ray Tyson )
Postal border was makin me mad
So get up in my cruiser , broke out of the pad
Rolled to the West Side to check out my boys
Twenty brothers in the park , all bringin the noise
Stepped out the car , Levis saggin
Gold around my neck with my limb-walk laggin
Walked up on my boys with the old chillin
The box with the big beats and my boys started illin
hoop game started so jump in
Had the hoods toughest team so just had to win
Diz to the outside , 2Pac up the center
ten minute game and we were the winners
The boys started smackin , talkin that slack and
Till he see my posse and the suckers started backin
Tried to say we cheat , because he got beat
Another lightweight sucker that can handle defeat
People wonder why choose to live the hype
Its not to understand , its just day in the life
Kick it its just day in the life

( 2Pac )
Finally Im on vacation and school is through
So here am , on Monday mornin with nothin to do
Tried to get outta my bed , but cant move
Ya see Im stuck to my matress like crazy glue
So there lay , for half the day just thinkin
Got up to brush my teeth cause my breath started stinkin
But was all alone so it wasnt no thing
Got up to take shower and heard the phone ring
Picked it up , the salutations , little bit frustrations
Who could be disturbin me on my vacation ?
Speakin on the phone in an aggravatin tone
Now know what Michael meant by leave me alone
So Im askin who is it ? and the answer shocks me
It was the voice of my homeboy Roc-T
Him and Dizzy had been waitin for me
Had show at three and now Im late as can be
Said have to take shower , Ill go ahead and take it
If leave within the hour , still might make it
Im rollin in sweatsuit , wasnt tryin to get cute
Hopped on to the stage and said : " Sorry that kept you "
started rappin , girls started clappin
Couldnt wait to finish so could start mackin
Jumped off stage , picked up the girl for the night
Huh , thats how Im livin , day in the life , come on
day in the life

( Ray Tyson )
Stretch white limo hits the colessium
crowd full of people sayin : " cant wait to see him "
Who is in the limo , who are they talkin about ?
Strictly Dope in the house , hear to turn the party out
We get out the car and can barely stand
Cause everywhere look are screamin fans
Girls on my tip but really dont sweat em
Theyll tear my new clothes if your bodyguradll let em
Hit backstage with two minutes to spare
Just enough time to grip breath of fresh air
We hear the introduction , the audience is loud
stepped out on the stage and then moved the crowd
Winners all over , we tried to leave the scene
But theres whole crowd of people at the limousine
Pen and paper in my face , couldnt be mean
So was signin autographs at the age of seventeen
People wonder why choose to live the hype
Its not hard to understand , its just day in the life
Kick it its day in the life

Kick it , kick it , kick it

( 2Pac )
Coolin with my posse at the neighborhood disco
Talkin to cutie as Im sippin on my cisco
Askin me to dance but keep on sayin " No "
Hate to dance fast , only like to do it slow
Dizzys on the dance floor , funky , funky motion
Girl keeps on sweatin me with sexual kind of totions
Roc is signin autographs makin girlies dizzy
Crowd sweatin Strictly Dope cause were gettin busy
Suckers wanna battle us , we move in silence
Strictly Dope is positive , were tryin to stop the violence
Started feel tipsy , Im lookin for the door
The Cisco had me dizzy , stumbled to the floor
And more try to sit up , the less seem to get up
My stomach starts to turn and my head feels wit up
The room begins to spin , pass out for the night
Just another way of livin day in the life , kick it

( Ray Tyson & 2Pac )
Knew was genius , soon as you seen this
Avoid hos value , dont have to redeem this
Teenage terror , no room for error
girl start dissin , and SCARE HER ! !
Risin like inflation on your favorite station
Rap is my forte and my recreation
Girls wanna kiss me , suckers wanna diss me
My mother didnt want me to be , but Ima emcee
The ladies desire , emcees admire
Thats why many hate me and call me liar
Hoods of the hype-tip , girls on the ill-trip
Im through rockin this whack , so thats it
am the high type , my style is so right
Its not hard to understand , its just day in the life
One love , one love , one thug
One nation , twenty-one gun salute

Im hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit ever wrote
Against all odds , up in the studio , gettin blowed
To the truest shit ever spoke

Twenty-one gun salute , dressed in fatigue , black jeans and boots
Disappeared in the crowd , all you seen was troops
This little nigga named Nas thinks he live like me
Talkin bout he left the hospital took five like me
You living fantasies , nigga reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass , now he out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why nigga blowed them out
Next time grown folks talk , nigga close your mouth
Peep me , take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy lets be honest you punk or you will see me with gloves
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me bein thug
You can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and know whats going on
Payback , knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness me strapped with Macs , knew wouldnt play that
All you old rappers trying to advance

Let it be known this is how you made me
Lovin how got you niggas crazy

Switch sides , guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that said

Lord listen to me

All my run-ins with authorities , felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life , so whats Hausa Nas ?

[ 2Pac ] They say

[ B-Legit ] Influenced by crime , addicted to grindin
[ C-Bo ] Where can pile up my chips

[ 2Pac ] been ballin since my adolescent years steady climbin
[ E-40 ] Man , you motherfuckers dont know nuttin about no timin

[ 2Pac ] Thats right , thats right boy start that shit off

heard rumour died , murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction , some coward got the story twisted
Like no longer existed , mysteriously missin
Although Im worldwide , baby aint hard to find
Why spend most of my time , my California grind
Watching for thievin Im cautious its like Im barely breathin
Puttin bullet in motherfuckers give me reason
See me and hope Im intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
Im addicted to currency in this life lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin , too scared to fight
For the life of me , cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin life after night of fuckin around with me
And if you dont like this rhyme
Then bring your big bad ass to California , cause we aint hard to find


got my locs on hard hat goin to war
Breakin them off on sight , stoppin lives like red lights
Watch em pause as pull my strap , out my drawers
And get to dumpin on they ass , like the last outlaws
Rich , 2Pac and the Click , smokin blunts , loadin clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we aint hard to find is the tales that we kick

Im fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
Im ridin shot gun with the tint in the back
Im plan to have motherfuckerin mint in this rap
Im from the V-A L-L E-J
Where sellin narcotics is all know
got blow , speed , bleed , whatever yo kind
And if you need motherfucker aint hard to find

Some may call me Bootsy , but call it timin
Thats while keeps on grindin ( thats right )
To the point where nigga cant stop
Too much feelin this shit , thats why Im quick to peel bitch
Whether its nigga or ho , ho
Get in my way , then that ass gots to go
Cause nigga steady plottin
serves hit for hit , and motherfuckers keep droppin


[ 2Pac ] C-Bo and D-Shot , E-40 , Richie Rich
[ E-40 ] Da Bay , beitch !

Down the steps
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy cant be scary
Playboy , what the fuck is the proof without the drama play
Nigga , what the fuck you got gun for , if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake all those I-was finst-to ask niggas
Motherfuckers-didnt think-I was-gon do-somethin ass niggas
Threaten your life , aint like you love him
Bury your thoughts , take his head fuck him have at him

Check this out
grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga

Double-edgin for the other side
But now , my Glock be so judgemental
Back seat of rental
Keep my name out your dental , nigga
If your gum bleeding and you needing
More than twenty stitches , you behaved like them bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game
Check the resident , its all the same
Nigga , and we aint hard to find

[ 2Pac ] Hell nah we aint hard to find

You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh about how got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin had her but she had me in the long run
Its just my luck Im stuck with fuckin with the wrong one
Wise decisions , based on lies we livin
Scandalous times , this games like my religion
You could be rollin with thug
Instead you with this weak scrub , lookin for some love
In every club
see you starin like you want it
Well baby , if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
Im still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as pause
Addicted to the fast life
try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin you aint impressed , with the money Im makin
Guess its true what they tellin me
Fresh out of jail , lifes hell for black celebrity
So thats the reason why call , and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin , can hit it ?
Addicted to the things you do , but still true , what Im sayin , boo
Is this is all about you

[ Hook : Nate Dogg ] ( x2 )
Every other city we go , every other vi-de
No matter where go , see the same ho

make promise if you go with me
Just let me know , Ill have you hollerin my name out before leave
Nobody loves me Im thug nigga
only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
love niggas cause we comin from the same place
Witness me holla at hoochie , see how quick the game takes
How can tell her Im playa and dont even care
Creep low , weed smokes in the air
Everywhere go , its all about the groupie hoes
Waitin for niggas at the end of every show
just seen you in my friends video
Could never put bitch before my friends , so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that Im goin through
Its all about you , yeah nigga

[ Hook ] ( x2 )


Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu ?
It aint about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to nigga why see the same shitty ho
You think its all about you ? Well boo , gets down like Dru
And my nasty new niggas , too

You couldnt hold me back , itd take fatter track
lyrical attack , perhaps , it was visual bluff
When started to snaps all your rode em swoll
Straight in control , flowsll fold , while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set , told Dramacy go in next
Gold digging , cold digging gold Rolex

slide in easily , try grizzly
Sluts know the cuts , came to fuck , try skeezin me
Runnin up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when bend ya
At the most , fucked bitch from the west coast to West Virginia

[ Hook ] ( x4 )

Big Syke , Newt , Hank

All eyes on me
Motherfuckin .
Roll up in the club and shit , is that right
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
But you know what ?

So many playa hatin niggas tryin to sound like us
Say they ready for the funk , but dont think they knowin
Straight to the depths of hell is where those cowards goin
Well are you still down nigga , holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
got caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until die ; live the life of boss playa
Cause even when Im high , fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes , cause all want is cash and thangs
five-double oh Benz flauntin flashy rings , uhh
Bitches pursue me like dream
Been know to disappear before your eyes just like dope fiend
It seems , my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than motherfuckin razor blade
Say money bring bitches , bitches bring lies
One niggas gettin jealous , and motherfuckers die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for second , but these punks wont get me
We got foe niggas , and low riders , in ski masks
Screamin THUG LIFE every time they pass all eyes on me

Live the life of thug nigga , until the day die
Live the life of boss playa , cause even gettin high
( All eyes on me )

Heeyyy , to my nigga Pac
So much trouble in the world , nigga
Can nobody feel your pain
The worlds changin everyday , times movin fast
My girl said need raise , how long will she last
Im caught between my woman , and my pistol , and my chips
Triple beam , got some smokers on , whistle as dip
Im lost in the land with no plan , livin life flawless
Crime boss , contraband , let me toss this
Needy hookers got lot of nerve , let my bucket swerve
Im takin off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack tech
Devoted to servin this , Moet and pay checks
Like Akai satellite nigga Im forever ballin
It aint right parasites triggers and fleas crawlin
Sucker duck and get busted , no emotion
My devotion is handlin my business , nigga , keep on coastin
Where you goin been there , came back as lonely homie
Steady flowin against the grain , niggas still dont know me
Its about the money in this rap shit , this crap shit
It aint funny niggas dont even know how to act , shit
What can do , what can say , is there another way
Blunts and gin all day , twenty-fo parlay
My little homie , cant you see , Im bust free
Niggas cant stand me all eyes on me


The feds is watchin , niggas plottin to get me
Will survive , will die , come on lets picture the possibility
Givin me charges , lawyers makin grip
told the judge was raised wrong , and thats why blaze shit
Was hyper as kid , cold as teenager
On my mobile callin big shots on the scene major
Packin hundreds in my drawers ; fuck the law
Bitches fuck with passion , Im livin rough and raw
Catchin cases at fast rate , ballin in the fast lane
Hustle til the mornin , never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as thug nigga until the day die
Live my life as boss playa , cause even gettin high
These niggas got me tossin shit
put the top down , now its time to floss my shit
Keep your head up , nigga , make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz , burnin rubber
The money is mandatory , the hoes is for the stress
This criminal lifestyle , equipped with the bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket
Get your money , motherfucker , lets get rich and well kick it
All eyes on me


Pay attention my niggas
See how that shit go
Nigga , walk up in this , motherfucker
And it be like , bing
Cops , bitches , everymotherfuckingbody
Live my life as thug nigga until the day die
Live my life as boss playa , cause even gettin high

live my life as thug nigga until the day die
Livin life as boss playa , cause even gettin high
Hehehe . . . its like what they think

They think Im goin back to jail , they really on that dope
Live my life as thug nigga until the day die

Live my life as thug nigga until the day die
Live my life as boss playa , cause even gettin high

Yall got me under surveillance , huh
All eyes on me , but Im knowin
( helicopter propeller turning )

We goin all out ( aiiiite )
We goin all out ( aiiiite )
We goin all out , watch ya motherfuckin mouth niggas
( Thats right , fuck these fag niggas )
Do it , do it , do it

Come hell or high water , down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul , stuck , callin Jehovah
Outlaw til its over , brand as my strap
Back like cobra , stay drunk , cause Im mad man
Whenever sober , on one man mission
My ambition to hold up the rap game
While pluck holes in niggas like donuts
And still down to die for all my souljas
Like hillbillies , they dont fear me
So refuse bringin war to the city
With each breath , death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me , no apologies , your honor
general in war , Im the first to bomb
With squad of trusted killers , quick to move shit heavily armed
Im similar to Saddam , sometimes question whos sane
Like fiends frantic for that last vein , stuck in the game
hit the scene like sandstorms , then transform , watch me
take the figure of dirty niggas , who all got me
While bitches wonderin who shot me
No love , keep grudge , shootin sluggs like Muammar Quadaffi
Murder my friends , build new posse
We takin shots at paparazzi , go and fly now , nigga like Rocky
You got lot of nerve to play me
Another gay rapper , bustin caps to Jay-Z
( buck buck buck buck buck buck )
And still avoid capture , while yall caught up in the rapture
Still after me , Im in Jamacia sippin daquiris , no doubt
We used to havin nothin , then grabbin somethin and bustin
Wanted to be the thug-nigga , that my old man wasnt
came to field , catchin cases , litigation
Niggas playa-hatin , got me crooked in all 50 states
Im screamin DEATH ROW , throw my WESTSIDE , aint no thang
We was raised off drive-bys , brought up to bang
We claim mob , . . . if you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this , Im hard to kill , when peel with this live spot
Father , how the hell did survive , these five shots ?
Live it up , of give it up , and my demons
Late night , hear them screamin ; we goin all out !

We goin all out , bomb first till they fall out
Take them the war route , without doubt
Ball , which means we all ride if its on
Each nigga handle ya own , bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay , nigga go all out
Bustas playin with ya peeps , betta go all out
Tryna see the next day , nigga go all out
Obstacles in ya way , you better go all out

Im on my land sled , walkin through the belly of the beast
Feelin like Im all out , drunk as can be
Its plain to see , that we mobb niggas hidin in bushes
Claimin that they ride rough , but they soft as they cushion
They softer than bitches in the worst way , drownin in blood
Outlawz my blood brothers , Id die for these thuggs
Say hi to this slug , its shame how some niggas on the west coast
Was ridin with Pac , but when he died , they went pop
Im on the Jers to the fullest , like some west coast love
But after Pac stopped rappin , it aint no west coast thug
Just westcoast what ? To my real niggas stuck in the street game
Cause rappers like Jay-Z be pumpin Kool-Aid through they veins
Is it true what Im sayin ? Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my fo-fo put peek holes through your door
ride or die , but these other fag niggas be bitin this
Its all from my heart when was writin this
All out


Now , we all ride , and down to die who wit us
Speak up , or get treated like you comin to kill us
Aint nothin but squealers , in this rap game , swearin they rough
Tattooed up , and now them niggas swearin they Pac
Stop that , and watch ya back , we aint forgot bout cha
These Glocks hot , and when shot , itll bring the bitch up out cha
Its me , Kastro with the goattee
Walkin like OG , cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me
pray to the thug lord , like that motherfuckers holy
Frontline soulja , till the heavens call me
go all out , and if you real , you real
Feel what Im talkin bout , cause this game is ill
live it , forbidden fruit , shoot , till they feel it
Livin proof , Pac breed niggas , they cant deal wit
Holla back , right back , and watch ya mouth
Or get blood in it , WHAT , we goin all out
Nigga

[ Hook ] 2X

Fool , you better go all out
Keep goin all out
All my niggas goin all out
Without muthafuckin doubt

Ey , you niggas just gon think that you gon be uhh
Talkin and slippin on all of these motherfuckin records
And we aint gon say shit , now its 1999
Its different grind , dont disrespect the Don
Its still war motherfuckers
So lets see you act like you know
ALONE
Lying , thinking
Last night
How to find my soul home
Where water is not thirsty
And bread loaf is not stone
came up with one thing
And dont believe Im wrong
That nobody ,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone .

Alone , all alone
Nobody , but nobody
Can make it out here alone .
There are some millionaires
With money
they cant use
Their wives run round like banshees
Their children sing the blues
Theyve got expensive doctors
To cure their hearts of stone .
But nobody
No , nobody
Can make it out here alone .

Alone , all alone
Nobody , but nobody
Can make it out here alone .

Now if you listen closely
Ill tell you what know
Storm clouds are gathering
The wind is gonna blow
The race of man is suffering
And can hear the moan ,
Cause nobody ,
But nobody
Can make it out here alone .

Alone , all alone
Nobody , but nobody
Can make it out here alone .
What of love unspoken ? Is it weaker without name ?
Does this love deserve exist without title
because dare not share its name
Does that make me cruel and cold
deny the world of my salvation
because chose let it grow
People tend choke
that which they do not understand
Why shouldnt be weary
and withhold this love from MAN
What of love unspoken
no one ever knows
But this is love that lasts
and in secrecy it grows
Take ones adversity
Learn from their misfortune
Learn from their pain
Believe in something
Believe in yourself
Turn adversity into ambition
Now blossom into wealth

dont fuck with you
You lil stupid ass bitch , aint fuckin with you
You lil , you lil dumb ass bitch , aint fuckin with you

She choosin , thats her decision , free my niggas in prison
On the phone with bitch who cant do shit

Got blunt in my dental , goin HAM in rental
On my way , to Sacramento , late night , Arsenio
Im never sentimental , go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley , Im chromeless , you might end up domeless
bet you she into me , her cheddar , she givin me
Ill make bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp , Pimp , underground king of the South
raise my Styrofoam up , and pour some drank in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news ?
Say you want me to win , but hope lose
Askin if rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool , its just that


got new chick that gotta thank God for
got new whip that gotta thank the lot for
Yeah got lot but want lot more
Yeah we in the buildin but Im tryna take it to the top floor
swear hear some new bullshit every day Im wakin up
It seems like nowadays everybody breakin up
That shit can break you down if you lose good girl
guess you need bad bitch to come around and make it up
guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got bad side , even conscience
Now youre drinkin til your unconscious
Feel me when you get fine bitch
Just dont forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin like Im in the Himalayas
Keep it with the lit on me like the elevator
Yeah know that karmas too real so hope you doin cool

We couldve been somebody
Thought youd be different bout it
Now know you not it
So lets get on with it

We couldve been somebody
stead you had to tell somebody
Lets take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves

Something strange is happenin

You couldve been somebody
We couldve ugh , we couldve been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon lie to the lawyer ?

Two-thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse

Gotta keep em separated , call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated , thats the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that

And Im about to take it to another level , bitch
No matter who you go and get
Aint nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track , triple double no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch , acting like owe her shit

Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so yeah had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said

If you wanna make your # your # now "
Mix that Goose and Malibu call it " Malibooyah "

Whatever want to do . Gosh ! Its cool now "
Know Im gonna do , ah , its the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
Cause youll never get on top of this
So mommy , best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with pharaoh ?
Put the pussy in sarcophagus
Now she claiming that bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won swallowship
Im living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is present , kiss my ass


Sasquatch , Godzilla , King Kong , Loch Ness
Goblin , ghoul , zombie with no conscience
Question : What do these things all have in common ?
Everybody knows Im motherfucking monster
Conquer , stomp ya , stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense , none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that Ive seen
still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder , murder in black convertibles
kill the block , murder the avenues
rape and pillage your village , women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love , dont get enough of it
All get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All see is these niggas made millionaires
Milling about , spilling they feelings in the air
All see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Trying to draw blood from my ice-cold veins
smell massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up


Pull up in the monster automobile , gangsta
With bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka

You could be the king but watch the queen conquer

Cause thats what motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan thats the monster do
Monster Giuseppe heel , thats the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and monster crew

And Ill let God decide
And wouldnt last these shows
So am heading home

Human beings in mob
Whats mob to king ? Whats king to God ?
Whats God to non-believer who dont believe in anything ?
Will he make it out alive ? Alright , alright , no church in the wild

Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of priest
Thanksgiving disguised as feast
Rolling in Rolls Royce Corniche
Cocaine seats , all white like got the whole thing bleached
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious ?
Socrates asked whose bias do yall seek ?
All for Plato , screech
Jesus was carpenter , Yeezy he laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost , get the hell up out your seats , preach


live by you , desire
stand by you , walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption

Coke on her black skin
Made stripe like zebra , call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until get me some
We formed new religion
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil , last night was mad real
Sun coming up , . . , wonder if they got cabs still ?
Thinking bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepherd
Two tattoos : one read " No Apologies "
The other said " Love is Cursed by Monogamy "


My momma was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin clothes you would have thought had help
But they wasnt satisfied unless picked the cotton myself
You see its broke nigga racism
Thats that " Dont touch anything in the store "
And its rich nigga racism
Thats that " Come in , please buy more "
" What you want , Bentley ? Fur coat ? diamond chain ?
All you blacks want all the same things "
Used to only be niggas , now everybody playin
Spendin everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves

You see theres leaders and theres followers
But Id rather be dick than swallower

Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up

Cause cant leave it to you
So lets get too high , get too high again
( Too high again , too high )

Uhh uhh uhh
You ready ? Lets go get em

Look for me ! Young ,
Cruisin down the Westside Highway
Doing what we like to do , our way
Eyes behind shades , this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today , got my thoroughest girl wit me
Im mashing the gas , shes grabbing the wheel , its trippy how hard
She rides with me the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we dont speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever , but soon as the show is over
Shes right back to being my soldier
Cause mamis rider , and Im roller
Put us together , how they gon stop both us ?
What ever she lacks , Im right over her shoulder
When Im off track , mami is keepin me focused
So lets lock this down like its supposed to be
The 03 Bonnie and Clyde , Hov and

[ Jay ] All need in this life of sin , is me and my girlfriend
[ Bey ] Down to ride til the very end , its me and my boyfriend
[ Jay ] All need in this life of sin , is me and my girlfriend
[ Bey ] Down to ride til the very end , its me and my boyfriend

The problem is , you dudes treat the one that you loving
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humping
That aint bout nothing if ever you mad about something
It wont be that ; oh no it wont be that
dont be at , places where we comfy at
With no be-atch ; oh no you wont see that
And no , aint perfect nobody walkin this earths surface is
But girlfriend , work with the kid
keep you working that Hermes Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs , Aviator lens
600 drops , Hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And dont have to worry , only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And do anything necessary for her
So dont let the necessary occur , yep !


( Talk to em )
If was your girlfriend
Ill be there for you , if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me
Yeah-hee ( break it down for em , )
Sometimes trip on how happy we could be
And so put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And promise Ill give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that breathe in , all that believe in
promise Ill give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

Yo this is Consequence
From the mighty Con Man Clique
And Im runnin with my man Kanye West
And when aint got pretty ho transporting boy and girl to the states
Im either on the 1-9 or out in the Chi
So we gonna up yo on how we chill , uh

It cost Kobe seven digits to pay off Bridgett
And get acquitted and break that bitch off , cause he aint did it
Here go the Henny swig it
You know its frigid
got em chillin in the cooler
Break out the ruler
Damn
Them the biggest tits ever seen
We smokin killer Cali gettin weeded
Make it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many . . , so much inspiration

get inspired by the stunts to
Ive run through
So many bitches in one crew
That now they riff over bones to pick
Till find one

Cause Quence is famous for totin stainless

Hey miss
Whos there ?
No time to do hair
Im through here
The show tonight
So get right
You look aight
Lets club now

Starts flavor while we grind in the theater
Im tryin to cut in the movies
Im tryin to give her something else to drink besides smoothie

Kids get broke when take bank and win
With the gold chains , throw game at your bitch like handball
Cause your boys all that
So fall back
be that real for 03 till

Chorus : [ x4 ]
This is how we chill from 03 until

This is how we chill for 03 till

My mack game does me well
And makes them hoes want to go and kiss and tell
All of Quences business

Any time got to go and slap silly trick

Niggas is jealous cause we in drops
The cops wanna stop us about every four blocks
Cause what we smokin them sacks got no seeds
And what they got in they pockets is no cheese

When Im postin you better tell them hot heads , " Stay cool "
Or exit because Im the exception to the rule
Im reppin to the dudes blocks with two Glocks
To bury ya
When they tear they aint jammin
Them cannons will make you drop
So Im doin tons of indo , showin off for hoes
Basically
My ace has been
Makin them sick tracks while was shootin pornos with your wisdom

Now bring some more stacks
Before you ask
About the price of the tracks
The game on smash
Look
Dont change the facts about these plaques
Because in fact
My freestyle hours over powers
Brothers cant hack it
Sensitive to truth and mack bitch
03 me , Quence and Plain Pat bitch

Yo its the Lake Shore Drive
Keep it live , tight , raw
You better hurry up , they cant keep it in the store
To be the format , your whole style on one beat
Insert the disk , watch nigga press delete
Tryna flex your technique
You gettin blasted with TEC , that shit is mad ironic
Like Alanis Morisette , you try but cant jet
Bunch of airline lyrics , rhymes for low fare
Flyin out of OHare
While these no-name ass niggas wanna go there , nobodies
Livin three blocks from nowhere , down the street from nothin
Let me show these niggas somethin , visual aid , the page
And the nigga who fronted , word to God , they dont want it
But they wanna play the role , actin hardcore
Watch the whole career , flow , my style is too cold
Always , forever like Luther , but it aint original
Because stole it from the future , now Im wanted in three centuries
The verbal killin , ask me where got the style
Told em from my grandchildren , put it on files
Document it in the books
You niggas cant see me so cease the hard looks
Ill rather it get took
Live and die for rhymes , dedicated to hip-hop
Shit dont stop
Niggas they wanna know what and whos next
And you roll up in Lex
Thats the train stop , my brain drop mad lyrics
rhyme with the spirit off the top , drop nonstop
Verbally killin , my style is ready to willin
Yall niggas stay back chillin
Like EPMD yall niggas aint seein me , what
Were enormous , nah , do or die
got the rhymes on the brain
They tried to bomb me on the plane so rode the train
Before got here [ ? ]
Im bout to save this shit , yo its my year , what ! ?
Bring it on , pass it to my man Tariq
Rock the mic all week
Ayo
Planes , trains , automobiles
The G500s with the auto-roll wheels
Pinot Grigio , got em on chill
See now , see me ho ? got that deal
If you tryna build , bet youd like to know that
My father was Black Panther with Geronimo Pratt
And back in college , aint run with no frat
just ran with the track that put the Chi on the map
Now the Roc in the buildin , UIC Pavilion
Two years ago was just civilian
Now every chick in here swear got millions
In area codes with unidentified children

Hold up , Im fuckin up the rap

Every chick in here swear got millions
In area codes with unidentified children
Put my hoodie on , blend in like chameleon
Hear barbershop talk , niggas try to kill him
Take my hoodie off , they like " Ye waddup , you chillin ! "
Swear to god they just like children
Just like high school , back at my school
Just like Halloween minus the costumes
The niggas thats flickin was the ones thats trickin
The girls two seatin was the ones thats treatin
Do test on relationship , everybody cheatin
used to want the Jordans thats most recent
Now throw Jordans on the whip just to look decent
Just to get pulled over by the precinct , so frequent
Its like Im back bein delinquent
They wanna know where live , stay , and work
Why young black nigga get all these perks
How stack my paper , got Adidas in every flavor
Excuse me officer , dont know Rod Laver
Or Stan Smith , what they dont understand is
How got that color in canvas

remember when got my 2nd car in 2005 . It was an 02 Honda Accord SE . Leather seats , doors , but it had wack stereo with cassette deck . was having none of this shit , so as soon as got $1000 christmas bonus at the newspaper was working at , went straight to the speaker shop . blew my entire bonus on PHAT speaker system and getting my windows tinted . remember rolling out of the shop and the first CD had in the booklet was Kanyes Late Registration ( burned copy of course ) . popped it in , " Heard Em Say " started bumpin and was ROLLIN HARD ! This beat was so money . . . Kanye had been great producer from the get-go , but he was coming into his own as rapper . Fast forward to 2013 and hes basically the biggest rapper on the planet . Forget the chill vibes of " Heard Em Say " . . . Adam Levine ? Ha . . . hell no . Kanyes got wayy too much to get of his chest on Yeezus to fuck with Maroon . This is guy on top of the world . . . literally . And looking at the world through his eyes is nothing short of fascinating







Yeezus is wayyyy more than rap . We see this the minute the album opens , on " On Sight " and Yeezy aint fuckin around . Hes got Daft Punk AND Benji producing the track with him ? The result is some HEAVY synth thats nothing short of cosmic . Think of the club in that new Tron movie where Daft Punk was playing . If you were at some club in the matrix or in outer space somewhere , this is the beat youd be hearing . Ye intersperses sick soul sample and just goes off on tirade , highlighted by gems like :
How much do not give fuck ?
Let me show you right now fore you give it upOk . . see where this is going . Right into another Daft Punk collabo on " Black Skinhead . " track filled with HUGE drum hits that he dropped dark and often times terrifying interactive video for . This is not just some regular-ass album release . This is next-level shit . We see him just not giving fuck by dropping perhaps the most disputed lyric of the year :
keep it 300 , like the Romans
300 bitches , where the Trojans ? Cant tell you how many fan boys and girls were FURIOUS at this one . " It wasnt the Romans in that movie ! It was the Spartans ! " But man , Kanye delivers it with such emphasis . He doesnt stutter for second and hes so wrapped up in the beat . Its like the brilliant thespian who skips line and you dont even notice , youre just enamored with the performance . He got everyone talking with this slip-up , or was it ?

Everything seemed so calculated with this album and it was genius stroke after genius stroke . The first taste we got of the record was the global premier of the " New Slaves " video . cryptic map on his website showed the locations of this video projection in major cities around the world . was in San Francisco at the time and trekked down to 2nd & Mission at 11pm with buddy and flask . This was some guerilla shit for sure . These surly dudes showed up with full-size pickup truck and what looked like 200 pound projector . The surly dudes pulled up the projector with all their weight to position it and they beamed Kanye up on high rise in the financial district that was maybe 300 yards away . This was surreal . The video played three times in row while the music blared on single massive speaker . By the 3rd time , we were rappin along . Sharing booze , dancing in the street . It was so dope . As it ended , yelled out scream " lets go to the next one ! " and we trekked over to Union Square for the 1145 showing . THIS is what being star is about these days . How you gonna top what the last guy did ? ! And there was nothing that felt contrived about it . You could feel Kanyes emotion on the Big Brother-like projection of his head against building







In fact , this the quality that sets Kanye apart , nothing feels fake . If youve seen interviews with the guy , he has SO much emotion . He truly believes in everything he says . THIS is art . Dude can say shit like " Am God " and it aint tongue in cheek at all . He knows the masses are hanging on his every word , just licking their chops waiting to derive meaning from it , waiting to break it down . THIS is the lens through which he looks at the world . Hes the face on the side of the building and you either soak it all up and act like you belong there with every inch of your body , or you dont cease the spotlight and become just another singer . But dont think that the spotlight doesnt get to him . It pisses him off . The ravenous media attention and countless organizations calling for his head infuriate him and it makes his expression that much more real and defining






For all the anger , for all the lines like " Put my fist in her like civil rights sign , " theres beautiful prose and social commentary with the impeccable Nina Simone sampled on " Blood on the Leaves . " He goes straight for the jugular with the provocative subject matter and puts difficult conversations at the forefront . " Blood on the Leaves " is masterpiece . Do yourself favor and read the annotations on Rap Genius , especially the words on the production of this song . Theres no issue this man is not ready to bring up . And Im just scratching the surface . could write into the night on this album . We could sit here and talk about Kanyes ability to elevate talent like Justin Vernon to the top of the indie rock world . We could re-hash his words in the countless interviews and rants , but theres no way could do it as well as the users on Rap Genius already have done ( in fact , to bring authenticity and the right frames of reference to this post , ive collaborated with Kanyes top scholar on RG to make many of the annotations youre reading right now . ) The annotated Yeezus is some of the richest content on the entire site . Dissecting every stanza , every beat , every move of this album , for the monumental accomplishment that it is . Even Lou Reed thinks so . LOU FUCKING REED ! Read his words , crumble your preconceived notion of Mr . West if you dont like him , if only for moment , to look into what his music and his ART is made of . Cause its unlike anything thats ever been done and theres much more to come . . . .

So pour the potion , so we could both get high , as we could go
Then Ill get the lotion , and do somethin to me , when your thighs is exposed
Theres no turning back now , mean dont mean to impose
Not now but right now , need you to undress , and then pose
Im into that now , catch vibe , when the doors , get closed
Roll up the doja , Henny and Coca Cola
And keep co coming over cause its never over

Maybe , baby , baby
You know was just kidding
Unless you gon do it ( You make me smile )

Felt so real to me
This is what was said

Thats big he said
Dig what he said , proceed he said
Indeed said , so
Breathe did
Dont repeat what say said , he said nothing
He agreed with his head
He just nodded like this
What believe to be yes repeated what was said
It came to me like whisper last evening said
Whats the deal playboy , was the greeting he said
First thing wanted to know , whats the reason he was dead ?
More money , more problems , better believe it he said
Careful what you wish for you might receive it he said
see said , jealousy said
Got the whole industry mad at me said
Then . . said , Hov remind yourself
Nobody built like you , you designed yourself
agree said , my one of kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said , said , has been said before
Just keep doin your thing he said , say no more

Til he crash like Sandra Bullock and Luda on the ave
He changed his name , he conscious rapper
Naw muthafucka Im just Comptons rapper
might spit some intricate shit for retards not to get
But really Im just as rude as Marshall Mathers
Is that contradiction ? He contradicting himself again ?
Of course thats contradiction , the fuck you think life is ?
We not like like Christ is
We all want ices and devices to make the bitches say like this
People dont understand why went southpaw
looked in the mirror and said cant be like yall
cant be like Game , cant be like Eazy
To get in this rap game , know it wont be easy
Cause my shit different
know
He from Compton , where he from , have he killed before ?
Truth is , aint the most ruthless , but Im not cupid
Before she had two kids my momma worked two gigs
To get out Chicago
To move right back to another ghetto , on Sante Fe playing the lotto
used to want champagne two door Tahoe
Until seen that same truck shot by five-o
Dead with his eyes closed , yall shouldve seen him
Off gallon of cough syrup , but rifles had leaned him
Thats why these tough rappers man dont believe em
Yall wanna be em , wanna grab bats and beat em
So they can feel the pain of the blocks Im from
Where my heart turned numb
And the powder and the shells come up off that gun
Come up off your chain , or come up off your life and have fatherless son
Its the syllabus for the ignorant militant mind
quivalent crimes for jail sentencin
No one preventin this war
You sure , you sure
Sure as the edges on every ocean , now lets explore
The Kendrick Lamar LP been promotin for bout month
Dont worry its comin soon , like fast nut
never be gassed up , some labels they passed up
Now the industry crashin , guess they got bad luck
Your bad , you dont write neither ? There goes another fad
Shit write ether
get it in like the Vanna on Wheel of Fortune forcin your forfeit
With the strength of the prime forces of four fork lifts
This is very extra necessary
This extra scary , this is Amityville
This the Exorcist on ecstasy pills
And if cant do it my integrity will
Head dog wishes , every Compton bitch is
mean this shit is
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
They all got fat ass but lower case titties
Now gotta mix and match , jungle fever , white and black
Double , Brittney , Becky get your mouth intact
Reg call em Jabberjaw , she gon hop skip and jog
Just to read my twitter blog
Man these hoes pitiful
And to you bloggers that say Im weak
You know how long took to chop this fuckin beat ?
Yall dont preciate shit
All yall do is hate shit
And if dont say shit yall still say aint shit
And thats ridiculous
mean that shit is
Fucking ridiculous

Oh when it all , it all falls down

Man promise , shes so self-conscious
She has no idea what shes doing in college
That major that she majored in dont make no money
But she wont drop out , her parents will look at her funny
Now , tell me that aint insecurr
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore , three yurrs , aint picked carurr
She like , fuck it , Ill just stay down here and do hair
Cause thats enough money to buy her few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby-daddy dont really care
Shes so precious with the peer pressure
Couldnt afford car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off , now she look like Eve
And she be dealin with some issues that you cant believe
Single black female addicted to retail , and well

Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
cant even pronounce nothing , pass that ver-say see !
Then spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like , nigga you aint up on this
And cant even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones thats clean and shirt with team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us , floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper , look how low we stoop
Even if you in Benz , you still nigga in coupe


say fuck the police , thats how treat em
We buy our way out of jail , but we cant buy freedom
Well buy lot of clothes when we dont really need em
Things we buy to cover up whats inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
Thats why shortys hollerin " where the ballers at ? "
Drug dealer buy Jordans , crackhead buy crack
And white man get paid off of all of that
But aint even gonna act holier than thou
Cause fuck it , went to Jacob with twenty-five thou
Before had house and Id do it again
Cause want to be on 106 and Park pushin Benz
want to act ballerific like its all terrific
got couple past due bills , wont get specific
got problem with spendin before get it
We all self-conscious , Im just the first to admit it

Now Syleena , you just like safe belt , you saved my life

Remember they used to call you that ?
What you say , Lauryn ?
Imma tell em

( Oh when it all )

Man promise , shes so self conscious
She has no idea what shes doing in college
That major that she majored in dont make no money
But she wont drop out , her parents will look at her funny
Now , tell me that aint insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophmore three years aint picked career
She like fuck it , Ill just stay down here and do hair

Cause her baby daddy dont really care
Shes so precious with the peer pressure
Couldnt afford car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you cant believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

Uh , and when it falls down who you gon call now ?
Cmon cmon , and when it falls down


Man promise , Im so self conscious
Thats why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas they done drove me crazy

Then spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this !

Dont stop that shit , keep that shit
Keep that part where ran out of breath
We aint doing no punching , man

Might cause shortness of breath , ya know ?
Couldnt have got nobody better for the job

They want me to catch clean then cook up dish for them
All of this just for them or they got diss for him
They want me to disappear like its gon shift for them
They say that Im in the way , they want me to sit for them
But what they admitting is they aint got shit for him
And really the fact is , we not in the same bracket
Not in the same league , dont shoot at the same baskets
Dont pay the same taxes , hang with the same bitches
So how am in the way , what is it Im missing ?

Swag off the chain , twenty-threes be chrome
Artful Dodgers with the Yeezys on

Step up in the club with nothing but all dykes
Sippin on some Louis and partyin all night
Phony-ass people , dont feel they demeanor
So hop in the rocket and go and chill over Venus
One of raps heroes , who came from zero
Makin something out of nothing , call me Gilbert Arenas
Now Im fuckin with divas that rock the stadiums
Blow my brains back til my face be numb

Rockin wit swagger like got an eight-feet gun
And my flow be colossal cause spit the impossible

See through prism when conquer an obstacle

Not behind the ho , but only behind the dough
And behind the dough kill whoever stand behind the door

And let them know why they aint fuckin with you

Youre goddamn right Im feeling myself
chauffeur , no sir , Im wheeling myself
Looking for chick chilling for self
So can show her the suicides and talk her into killing herself
Im having problems dealing with wealth
But you wouldnt understand it , until you get million yourself
You niggas mustve got deal for your health
Your CD is frozen food , it just chills on the shelf
spend big , at any time can start splurging
The twin SIGs open chests like heart surgeon
And Im buttoned up , Im just blue-collar crook
But keep stack thick as few college books
got new polished look
And 20 dime bitches , to show yall niggas how my dollars look
The boys got at least digits on
So the guns gotta be at least midget long
The money , is like 10 bridges long
throw bread around just to turn pigeons on
got some good smoke just for puffers
The grand 20s make the hustlers suffer
Plus its fluffer , than cotton ball
Ive gotten calls wanting me to put the pot in malls
But nowadays you cant put it past em
got Dan Marino arm , Im bout to throw some bullets past em
And the niggas in the hood keep quoting my lines
dont jump ship , keep floating in mine
Long as keep toting , Im fine
Ima have these dick sucking niggas deep-throating the
jumped in the English ship , Benzed whip
Its Terminator chrome the engines dip
Im reading scripts , no , not the penmanship
The box-office shit , box off this bitch
Jessica Alba , Kirsten Dunst
And still make mil on the first of months
These dudes be the first to front
Til their family and friends is in limos , they in hearse in front
Im in the top position , can make you proposition
Im in the hard top waiting on the drop edition
To hell with the patience
Ima send nigga down under like Australia vacations

Yeah it is what it is
My niggas just killed yall and Imma close the casket

Im tryin not to let this industry get the best of me , yall
work hard for the fame , the games stressing me yall
All they do is complain what they expect from me yall
From the hood to Hollywood , theyre respecting me yall
And even overseas , theyre accepting me yall
All the ladies show me love , the thugs repping me yall
get lot of dirty money , so expect me to ball
But Im saving all my checks , Im investing em all
They say , what goes up is gon definitely fall
Even the stars , but success is my destiny , yall
Look , cook tracks got the recipe , yall
You cant name another cat that can mess with me , yall
At the shows all the hoes be molesting me , yall
got broads crying trying to get next to me , yall
got broads craving begging to have sex with me , yall
Screaming , " Cass you dont know how sexy you are ! "
And Im happy Im alive , Gods blessing me yall
And all the problems that arrive is God testing me yall
So pray everyday , but aint praying too much
Cause be sinning everyday , so aint praying enough
And we all could be beat , and aint saying Im tough
But if its beef dont speak , aint saying " Whats up "
If its beef when we meet then Im spraying shit up
Prraat prraat . aint saying too much and thats that
Cause that cat you embracing with love
Might clap that gat cause he got hate in his blood
Keep your friends at distance and your enemies close
Cause the folks you call friends tend to envy the most
Some catsll hang themselves if you give em rope
Burn the bridge and dont give boat , let em sink
Sometimes you gotta give em some some time to let em think
But sometimes you gotta give em the and let em stink
You cant bring every horse to the pond and let em drink
Id rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink
As soon as your eyes shut , them niggas will ride up
And the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up
And we all gotta die but , aint ready to leave
Thats why , even if its petty , Ill be ready to squeeze
But put cheddar in cheese , the guac-a moola
pop the Ruger , send that hot shit through ya
Like booya , thats the sound when the pound busting
Ooh , ah , youll be laying on the ground suffering
Clownings nothing to pull out and blast you
try to only resort to violence if have to
But , man , niggas out here are playing fair
So before the odds even Im leaving them laying there
And aint even playing , believe what Im saying here
Cause before this shit gets further your click gets murdered
And found in hole in the grass
For trying to play that thug role Ill stomp mud hole in your ass
And this Cass , nigga , Im that sick
Full Surface nigga , Im that shit

The rapper is insane flowing like mad river
Make your ass quiver like you naked at winter
Hollygrove honcho , hard time giver
Im shark in the water , you just Long John Silver

Her name is millimeter


If got slugs , bullets gone fly
If got red beam , people gone die
mamas gone cry , spirits in the sky
preachers preaching , sermons telling lies
Cause each and every one of yall niggas wasnt shit
would have rather kept the rugers in the ruger clip
The index finger slipped , the let spit
lick em all like eighteen tits on chicks
Im suicide risk , slits on each wrist
If die times the next go-arounds bitch
And if come back , Ill throw 99 shows
And shove inches of dick in 99 hoes


Im west coast original , black John Wayne
Nigga where we from we like to pop that thang

Fat mouth to Dogg and Ima pop-pop bang
Pigs wanna bust me , hoes wanna suck me
Niggas wanna touch me , none of that , trust me

Shoe box , no shoes in em

And can get em for the sweet 16
Hard dope , call it HD Flat screen
Fuck outta here , your shit water whipped
You got that tan dope , look like Florida bitch
Automatic leave em dead in the living room

Fuck all these niggas and tell them bitches to kiss my ass

Rack em up , pool table full of balls


Soft white , got that G-mix

Trick hundred hoes , spend few chips

Bitch Im blowing up like napalm
Got your bottom bitch going AWOL
Niggas looking at ya like you fell off
No sir , not me
Im double platinum just like my Ferrari
Bullet proof nigga Teflon
Why you snorting that , that shit stepped on

But me , me , see me , got the world in my hands

Im hell of smoker , and bit of drinker

Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking bout abortion

woke up this morning , dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business , then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly , called Makaveli
He says he was gravy , say was jelly
Looked in the mirror , said " Yous an ill nigga "
Then ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now think Ill have me coffee with six sugars
In world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
Im tryna walk straight line but the line crooked
Im shooting for the stars , astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah , bought brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears , got my dancin shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But just built house on Dont Give Fuck Avenue


Down on the ceiling , looking up at the bed
Life is gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks , just enjoy the head
Im so sick of these niggas , need meds
Smoking on that hallelujah , thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double , Im rebel with reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit , see myself as seed
Living in the glass , and everybodys looking
But how can you get the picture , if you dont know who took it ?
This current affairs , but who the hell cares ?
Everybodys fighting over positions , musical chairs
On the road to redemption , you gonna use few spares
Im just fucking ready so come prepared


And the rockets red glare , the bombs bursting in air
Life is roller coaster , but still unfair
blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise , we dont know that its there

Aiyyo , ya niggas must be outcha fucking mind
Thinkin dog cant pull another motherfucking rabbit out the hat
Nigga aint gotta check out my motherfucking sleeves you bitch ass niggas
Fuck is yall niggas

Even if we squashed the beef , aint touching ya hand
dont bunk with chumps , for those who been to jail
Thats the cat with the Kool-Aid on his lips and pumps
dont fuck with niggas that think they broads
Only know how to be one way , thats the dog
know how to get down , know how to bite
Bark very little , but know how to fight
know how to chase cat up in the tree
Man , give yall niggas the biness for fucking with me , is you crazy ? !


Once song , come through , guns is drawn
Blam blam , lungs are gone , sons will mourn
From dusk till dawn , nighttime belongs to the dog
On the street passed midnight , look for em in the morgue
Dont play with these cats cuz aint got nothing to say to these cats
For the mothers that really do love em , please pray for these cats
Cuz know niggas is hardheaded but aint got the patience
Dont want me havin no patience turn into more patients
More trips to ICU cause see you
Tryna get away with shit real nigga wouldnt do
Where my dogs at ? ( RIGHT HERE ) See them niggas ? ( RIGHT WHERE ? ! ? )
GET EM BOY ! ( RIGHT THERE ) Thats how we do . . . ( AIIGHT THEN )
This is for my dogs , this is for my dogs

From then till now , dont ask me how

Five CDs with mad rhymes
Dont hit me with that positive shit , know you lying
You really wanna stop niggas from dying ? Stop niggas from trying
cuz aint really got that time to waste
And thought told you to get these fucking bums out my face
Looking at you in your grill , might be nice to cut
Once split ya ass in two , youll be twice as butt
Yeah , you right , know ya style : pussy , cause Im fucking it
Since we all right here , you hold my dick while he sucking it
Motherfucker , dont you know youll never come near me
Shove ya head up ya ass , have you seein shit clearly
Never heard that be running , cause be gunning

Empty clips and shells are what leave behind
And if they get me with the joint , they hit me with three-to nine

aint gonna eat , aint gonna sleep
Aint gonna breathe , til see what wanna see
And what wanna see , is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently , you just being hurt
This aint gonna work for me
It just wouldnt be , sufficient enough
Cause we , are just gonna be , enemies
As long as we breathe , dont ever see , either of us
Coming to terms , where we can agree
There aint gonna be , no reasoning , speaking wit me
You speak on my seed , then me , no speak-a ingles
So we gonna beef , and keep on beefing , unless
Youre gonna agree , to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face , and youre gonna see
demon unleashed in me , that youve never seen
And youre gonna see , this gangster pee on himself
see you D12 , and thanks , but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely
dont need fifteen of my homies
When see you , Im seeing you , me and you only
We never met , but best believe you gon know me
When Im this close , to see you exposed as phony
Come on bitch , show me , pick me up , throw me
Lift me up , hold me , just like you told me
You was gonna do , thats what thought , youre pitiful
Im rid of you , all of you , Ja , youll get it too !

Now go to sleep bitch
Die , motherfucker , die
Ugh , times up , bitch , close ya eyes
Go to sleep , bitch ( what )

Go to sleep bitch ( what )
Why are you still alive
Why , die motherfucker , ah , ah , ah

We got you niggas nervous
On purpose , to hurt your focus
Yous not MCs , yous worthless
Yous not them Gs , yous circus
Yous no appeal , please
Yous curtains , you use words Kool Herc slurred in two thousand third
Yous purping , yous no threat , whos ya serving
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with label overseeing the Earth
Shady muthafucka , . Trices birth
And as mold , become curse
So we can put down the verse , take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze , and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse
And as breathe , and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
Yous not the streets , yous the desk
Use not your chest nigga , use vest
Before twos choose ya rest , you chose death
Six feet deep , nigga , thats the depth


Hey dog , Imma walk like beast , talk like the streets
Imma stay blazing New York with the heat
Stalk on the beat , walk wit MY feet
Understand my pain , the rain aint sleet
Peep how Im moving , peep where Im going
Shit dont seep , then sleep not knowing
But Imma keep growing , getting larger than life
Easy going with the same one that started the fight
He be knowing how dog get , when dog dont bite
Tried to show him the dog shit , its dog for life
Grand Champ , and my Blood Line is tight

Thats why you layin on your back , lookin at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin the truth and it hurts


Off the chain leave niggas soft in the brain
Cause niggas still want the fame , off the name
First of all , you aint rapped long enough
To be fuckin with me and you , you aint strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin on that got you think that you Superman

You wack , youre twisted , your girls ho

Cause if end up fed , yall end up dead
Cause youse soft type nigga

Rob niggas on ravine , dont make it murder scene
Give dog bone , leave dog alone
Let dog roam and hell find his way home
Home of the brave , my home is cage
Aiyyo Imma slave til my home is grave
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us


Look what you done started , asked for it , you got it
Had it , should have shot it , now your dearly departed

Niggas aint never did shit to me , bitch ass niggas cant get to me
Gots to make the move , got point to prove

Try to keep your mind , on gettin pussy and crime


Talk is cheap , motherfucka
This life shit , this life shit , is like , is like
Bugged the fuck out son , for real
See to live is to suffer but to survive
Well , thats to find meaning in the suffering

Ay yo Im slippin , Im fallin , cant get up
Ay yo Im slippin , Im fallin , cant get up
Ay yo Im slippin , Im fallin , gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so can tear shit up

Ive been through mad different phases like mazes , to find my way
And now know that happy days are not far away
If Im strong enough Ill live long enough to see my kids
Doing something more constructive with their time than bids
know because been there
Now Ima there sit back and look
At what it took for me to get there
First came the bullshit the drama with my Mama
She got on some fly shit so split
And said that Ima be that seed
That doesnt need much to succeed
Strapped with mad greed
And heart that doesnt bleed
Im ready for the world or at least thought was
Bagging niggas when caught buzz
For thinking about how short was
Going too fast , it wouldnt last but yo couldnt tell
Group homes and institutions , prepared my ass for jail
They put me in situation forcing me to be man
When was just learning to stand without helping hand
Damn , was it my fault , something did
To make father leave his first kid at seven doin my first bid
Back on the scene at fourteen with scheme
To get more cream than Id ever seen in dream
And by all means will be living high off the hog
And never gave fuck about much but my dog
Thats my only muthafucka had offered my last
Just another little nigga headed nowhere fast


That aint the half shit gets worse as get older
Actions become bolder , heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that dared nigga to touch
Didnt need clique cause scared nigga that much
One deep with the pit starting shit for kicks
Catching Vicks throwing bricks gettin by being slick
Used to get high to get by used to have to puff my
In the morning before get fly
Ate something couple of forties made me hate something
did some coke now Im ready to take something
Three years later showing signs of stress
Didnt keep my hair cut or give fuck how dressed
Im possessed by the darker side living the cruddy life
Shit like this kept nigga with bloody knife
Wanna make records but Im fucking it up
Im slippin , Im falling , cant get up


Wasnt long before hit rock bottom
Niggas talking shit was like damn look how that rock got him
Open like window
No more endo
Look at video
Sayin to myself that couldve been yo
Ass on the TV
Believe me , it could be done
Somethings got to give
Gots to change cause Ive got son
gots to do the right thing for shorty
And that means no more gettin high , drinkin 40s
So get back looking type slick again
Fake niggas jump back on my dick again
Nothing but love for those that know how it feel
And much respect to all my niggas that kept it real
Kept nigga strong , kept nigga from doing wrong
Niggas know who they is and this is yo fucking song
And to my boo who stuck with nigga through
All the bullshit youll get yours because its due

Blood out , blood in

In the fog , the fog , living in the fog
How you gonna see em if you living in the fog
How you gonna see em if you living in the fog
The snake , the rat , the cat , the dog
To be continued motherfuckers
want you to ask yourself one question
If you had 24 hours to live , what would you do ?
Thats some deep shit right there , lot of pressure
How would you handle it ?
Mase , what would you do ?

Yo , Id turn out all the hoes thats heterosexual
Smack conceited niggas right off the pedestal
Id even look for my dad that never knew
And show him how look in my Beretta , too
Id do good shit like take kids from the ghetto
Show them what they could have if they never settle
Take every white kid from high class level
Show em what Christmas like growin up in the ghetto
Teach niggas how to spend , stack the rest
Give blunts to the niggas under massive stress
Give every bum on the street cash to invest
And hope Harlem will blow up be my last request

Yo , yo if had twenty four hours to kick the bucket , fuck it
Id probably eat some fried chicken and drink Nantucket
Then go get jar from Branson
And make sure leave my mother the money to take care of grandson
Load the three power , hop in the Eddie Bauer
And go give all six to that papi that sold me flour
Get fresh baldy , make few calls
Shop at the mall , shoot lil ball
Have all of my bitches on one telly at the same time
Spread it out on different floors
And Im gonna play lotto , for what ?
Even though aint gonna be here tomorrow , so what

You know when was close to the ledge
Id probably be in the wedge
With this bare Spanish mami playin tween my legs
Then Im off to get choke and smoke one of them dreads
And get that bitch from 89 that gave us up to the feds
Thought of momma , wrote her note , we aint close
hate her boyfriend so put one in his throat
Fuck around and sniff an ounce of raw , bust the four
Pause , pull out my dick and take piss on the floor
Jump in the whip , get them cats wanted to get
Since the Tavern on the Green robbery in 86
Went home took shower in ice cold water
And spent my last hours with my son and my daughter

If you had 24 hours to live just think
Where would you go ?
What would you do ?
Who would you screw ?
And who would you wanna notify ?
Or would your ass deny that your ass about to die ?


What hey yo , if had 24 nigga gotta get the raw
Run all them papis spot , put one in his head at the door
For the times that paid for twenty and he gave me twelve
The other eight had to be baking soda by itself
So papi fuck you , you dead now , Im off to the bank
With those bricks in book bag and stolen Jag just grabbed
Went in there grabbed the bank teller with the pretty face
Fuck her in the safe , and have her take me to my place
Well make kid but thats selfish and thatll be bad
For my son to have the same shit his pops just had
And when Im down to 23 , Imma be strapped with TNT
Run up in city hall and take the judges with me

If had 24 hours to live , Id probably die on the fifth
Run in the station squeezin the inf
Ill be waitin to get to hell and bust down Satan
Styles on this shit and got spot vacant
Back to the 24 make it out the precinct
Shootin niggas that hate in they face while they eatin
Im on the job robbin every so-called Don
Give the money to my moms and tell her that Im gone
would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm
He should learn to tell the future without readin palms
When they come in with the bullets , you prepared with the bomb
So fuck bein violent get stocks and bonds

24 left until my death
So Im gonna waste lot of lives , but Ill cherish every breath
know exactly where Im goin , but Imma send you there first
And with the shit that Ill be doin , Imma send you there worse
Ive been livin with curse , and now its all about to end
But before go , say hello to my little friend
But gots to make it right , reconcile with my mother
Try to explain to my son , tell my girl love her
C-4 up under the coat , snatch up my dog
Turn like three buildings on Wall Street , into fog
Out with bang , you will remember my name
wanted to live forever , but this wasnt fame

[ LL Cool ] Make it butter

Politic , keep the chickenheads gobblin

Terrorize your city , from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty , smack the drivers head in the chin see

Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic

Im the illest nigga alive , watch me prove it
snatch your crown witcha head still attached to it
Canibus is the type wholl fight for mics
Beatin niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough , start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough , and then Ill call your bluff
Like , " Yo , how many rhymes you got ? " think Ill go on
For more Milleniums than Mazdas got on the car lot
And theres nowhere to run ta , when confront ya
Nigga , call your bluff like you had phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild , who wanna act fly and
Get shot down with surface-to air missile
take em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who aint close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty ? Im already doin hundred
When Im blunted and give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark , cause if catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown , come up off that , or Im gon gun it down
When in doubt , however skull goes , its gon be that
See that , that shitll finish you dawg , believe that
Where we at , do you value your life , as much as your possessions
Dont be stupid nigga learn lesson

Let me get whats between your sock , cause its , better to give
Than receive , believe what say when tell you
Dont make me put you somewhere where nobodyll smell you
And when the lights is out , they dont come back on
This aint flick you aint gon come back on
You aint that strong
You knew it was wrong , but you asked for it baby
Youse pink nigga , ski mask for it baby
So can hit you up on Front Street , you think Im sweet

Blaze the hot trizack , shine like heaven
Seven , six , five , four , three , two , one
Come on Mr . Smith , come get some

When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed ( yeah , word up )
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
Imma do this shit for free this time this ones for fun
Blow you to pieces , leave you covered in feces
With one thesis ( " LL Cool is hard " )
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But thats like picking up ball , playing with Mike
Swingin at Ken Griffey or challenging Roy to fight
Snapping , you ameteur MCs
Dont you know Im like the Dream Team touring overseas
For rappers in my circle Im deadly disease
Ringmaster , bringing tiger cub to his knees
In the history of rap theyve never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance
Now lets get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side itd transform into time bomb
You dont wanna borrow that , you wanna idolize
And you dont wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socalize
And Im daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position , and mention my name
make rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth dont ever step out of line
LL Cool nigga , greatest of all time
Get niggas , toe down , clap quick , blam , blam , blam
Go down that quick
Acting like the truth is gone
This two piece leave your faggot ass toothless son
Hold up , done show you why the dog is the illest
Killers , you might not catch it , but you feel this
The realest nigga to ever do it
The realest nigga to ever go through it
Uhh
Swizz beats ( Uhh uhh )
Nigga , ryde or die ( uhh uhh uhh )

Aint no way youre gonna stop my shine
Aint no way you niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo mind , dont know why

What the fuck is you niggas pressin me for

If was testin your jaw , maybe then you would respect me
But you cant respect me cuz you dont even know me
Nigga check me ( come on )
Im that motherfucker thatll put you to sleep , while you sleepin
Red dot from hundred feet , you just knew you was creepin
Bad decisions lead to last decisions

You got minute for yo son father , need to talk
Im so tired of tryin to run father , lets take walk
Im so sorry for what done father , it aint my fault
But the devils been on my back lately , hes like hawk
You never give us more than we can handle , but its gettin hard
And Im strong individual , but need you God
Lot of things that used to , dont wanna
Run the streets like used to , know Im gonna
Speak the word for you one day
Up in there like , " Hallelujah ! " on Sunday
thank you Lord for the blessings that you gave me
And for my life with the blessings you have saved me
And for my wife you have carried me enough times and thats the truth
Married me to rough times , throughout my youth
And through it all saw that you was still with me
was that one lost sheep and you was comin to get me

Lord you got me like . . your love got me like . .
Lord you got me like . . your love got me like . .
Lord you got me like . . your love got me like . .
Lord you got me like . . your love got me like . .

look at life little different now , since you hugged me
And always loved my peoples , but now they love me
Thank you for the love Lord , we praise ya
Jacobs descendants , from Africa to Asia
Pleadin the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right , just help us make it through the night and well
Shout yo name in times of need
And times of joy , and , when we bleed
And , when we are overcome with greed
You aint gon half to tell me twice , Imma take heed
And because of what youve given me , know youll deliver me
And wont drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength , never knew had
Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad
All praises due to ya
Thats why had to dedicate somethin new to ya , thank you father


Uhh . .
never knew love like , this before
Messin with the thug life , missed it all
You opened the doors and , let me in
Im down for the cause so , lets begin
Prayers that you give to me give to them
Same way you live in me live in them
Life is blessing now
You got me smilin from inside of my heart , when inside it was dark
And it doesnt rain anymore
Only sunshine , no pain anymore , really love my
You washed away the tears with the fears
Im happier than Ive ever been in my life , the whole thirty years
You know that ! one day Ill speak the word
You know that ! when do will be heard
You know that ! you gave me permanent smile
And you know this father because Im yo child , what ?

[ Hook ] repeat 2X
What good is it . .
For man to , gain the world . .
Yet lose his own soul , in the process ?
[ Bell ] God loves you , yes he does
Said youre alright with him
[ DMX ] wonder . .

Chorus : Regina Bell ( repeat 2X )

know you never seen him but dont fight with him
Youre gonna make it through the night to the light with him
Uhh , youre alright with him
said youre alright with him

Im callin out to you Lord , because need your help
See once again Im havin difficulty savin myself
Behavin myself , you told me what to do , and do it
But every and now and then , gets little harder to go through it
Losin friends , day by day
Im in so much pain when Im here Lord , please take me away
put you here to do job , and your work aint done
To live is to suffer , but youre still my son
And there will be time when you shine as bright as the stars
But there wont be , his or hers , just ours
Then youll see what Ive been tryin to show you , all these years
Do the right thing ; cause after the tears , come the cheers
will , my Lord , with my heart , and my soul
Thats gonna be how roll , from now until Im old
Lead and Ill follow , you take away the sorrow
Imma sleep on what you said and holla back tomorrow

Chorus

want you to know Lord , that for what youve given me Im thankful
Sincerely , from the bottom of my heart , Im grateful
You gave us power in our words , so think before speak
And that way when speak , they know Im here to teach
Cant tell em nothin wrong , cause love em too much
reach lot of people , and Lord , Im lovin the touch
But deep inside , Ive got somethin thats workin against
Everything know is right , what know makes sense
Thats when you must fight harder , than youve ever fought before
Cause what youve got goin on inside you is war
Between good and evil , be careful of those who wanna be you
They smile , but are not really happy when they see you
Be careful of the ones that always wanna get you high
Cause when the time comes , that onell let you die
Listen to me ! Im here , but can only help you
If you want me to help , what do you want for yourself ?

Chorus

My Lord , my saviour , dont judge my behaviour
But instead , take whats in my heart and put it in my head
See guess really never knew , how proud made you
My life is yours , my soul gave you
dont know if Ill do good enough ( hes by your side )
And we both know the hood is rough ( right by your side )
Sometimes dont know what to do ( , dry your eyes )
But know what gotta do ( itll be alright )
You keep givin me the word , and Ill put it to song
Talk to me , Ill talk to them , and we cant go wrong
This is the start of somethin strong , and this is just the start of it
Praises to you my Lord , for lettin me be part of it
was that kid that , been there , did that
Became ashamed so hid that
But , aint no longer with that
Use me as an example if can do , then they can too
With the Lord behind us , there aint nothin that we cant do

Chorus

Hes by your side
Right by your side
, dry your eyes
Cause itll be alright
Yeah , hes by your side
Right by your side
, dry your eyes
Cause , itssssssssss gonna be alright
Yeah yeah , yes it isssssssssss

Death is in the air , and dont know if its mine
But know if its time , itll be what it is
And all can think of is what about my kids

Dogs that call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things do for my friends
We miss you ! AYO KATO !

Started off two dogs with the same goal ( uh ! )
Nothing but two dogs walkin the same road ( uh ! )
Two different cultures , but had the same heart ( yeah )
Enjoyed seeing the light , but lived in the dark
5th Avenue , bumped heads in the parking lot ( aight )
Was quite brother , didnt like to bark lot
Came direct ( uh ) , when he came , gave respect
So gave respect , ( uh ) we shared the same respect
To name regret , in our own circles
Two brothers with good hearts , but if you start
Two brothers thatll hurt you ( yeah )
Know how that dirt do , Hittin four corners
( arf , arf , arf , ARF ) Right back upon us
God tried to warn us , but sometimes we dont see
When first heard Im like " THIS CANT BE !
Yall niggas is bugging
Got the wrong information or something
Please tell me these niggas is frontin "
God know . .

Dogs that call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things do for my friends

DOGS FOR LIFE , and you . . . rode to the end
Held dog down , didnt let day go by
Everytime dog came the the shy

Now come back to Phoenix and like " damn its hard "
To accept the fact , that you wont be coming back
But hope you coming back , cosI wont accept the fact
When you came to New York , you had to come to the crib
And vice-versa , ( yeah ! ) , thats just how we did
Remote control cars , ( WHAT ! ) , we would rac all day
It was adventure , we would chase our day ! ( yeah ! )
So Im not gonna say goodbye my nigga
Instead would rather
Focus on the time we spent together , thats what matters


Need you to save me spot , next to you and the lord ( aight )
Dont know when Im coming , but keep checking the door ( aight )

You gon think until you really see me gon , Im frontin
Maybe if you kept your friends of respectable distance
Out of our business , wouldnt have to come and visit

When them bitches through , aint to co sure when they home
But that aint never stopped yo ass from passin on the Guess

You aint nothing but stupid bitch . Bitch !



Fuck what they all say
Niggas cant stop me with rumors , Im too strong
All day , socks exploding sweat pants pockets is bulging
Holding it down on the corner with my block frozen
My spot is rolling , drop the price of the coke and
Drove the competition out and let the doe flow in
The cops is closing in , can do the time
But whats really on my mind , there aint no hos in the pen
play the low and try to make it hard to find me
Feds still tryna build case since 93


Yo , moves is made , Niggas is paid , thats just how it is
When my time is up , Ima be out but ima try to live
Im eating day by day aint nothing sweet about it
Act like you dont know what Im saying and theyll read about it
Built for war like an armadillo
Smother your ass with through the pillow
Cause my shit is brillo
Manic depressive and my head hurts
Yo , give me your doe and your ho
And here take these four hot things , got things
That make niggas spin , put niggas in the wind
Where you never see niggas again
bless nigga with stitches , the thin type
And straight razor will put pin stripes , across your wind pipes


Start off my day and Im off and running and miss my gun
Im often blessed but not these days cause its no longer fun
am way worse then banger with bullets left in the chamber
Cant imagine the danger , you done got these bow tie bangers
What stranger didnt know , get out control
You think dont get tempted , that ol be lie of joke
Jehov this outside out position , got this stress on my mind
But get inside out postion , coming from my own god
We walk in beef but dont provoke it , we aint gon run
We fight we hold what right with us but nigga aint the one
You niggas oughta be glad og god hold of us
Cause if it wasnt for that man , there be no controlling us
His body laid in red blood twisted and broken
Holding his blood puddle soaking , his clothing look like roses
Spinning vultures at moses couldnt save him
We leaving him where we came osalamalekam
DMX :
Uhh , uhh
If Im gonna rob , ima rob all night
If Im lookin for somethin its probably fight
If Im goin fuck bitches then they better be tight
If thats dead , then the head better be right
If gots to play ima play til win
Since gots to be here cant wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty cant stand shorty friend
Cause honey friend fuck many many men
Stay wit the rats cause the rats is real
Wanna fuck , then we fuck , already know the deal
Shit , fuck what you look like , just show the real
And keep spot that we can go to chill

Only reason come around is for the hoes
Pipework lay it down for the hoes
Hit em off with that dark brown , you know ?

2Pac :

Life as rap star

Watch them niggas out the sight of mah night scope
Cooking white dope
Got mah nigga 25 to life stretched out
Trying to have all the better things in life

Changing niggas future like schizophrenic palm reader
Heeds from out the bible read
See the meek shall inherit the earth
And the strong will lead
Hittin weed like it alright

My enemies cry whenever rise
They hated till death
Try to beat me out my last breath

DMX :

Judge find out its my team , he boost they bails
Niggas throw us on they album , try to boost they sales
We put our pies on the table and our eyes on label

Blown away ( will be blown away )
Like the wind ( yes )
Like the wind blow

Yea , uh
From 80 school street to way across town
Cats knew how got down cause word got around
was that robbery kid with no gun and no mask
Catch nigga out the door slippin thats yo ass
Didnt laugh much cause didnt have much
Life was like stick half gas half clutch
Meaning half good and half bad
It was good if caught good vic if didnt was bad
Took it out on my regulars
Id come through and if niggas was broke took watches and cellulars
Went to jail few times but that didnt stop me
All it taught me was how not to be sloppy
An older cat robbed me when was like 10
If anybody wanted to help they shouldve did it then
But they didnt and all it did was release the beast
So Im feast on whatever come across in the streets

had " " on my chest fuck the vest
Did robberies with some cats and robbed the rest
Other times came thought with just me and my dog
And clear out the whole fuck block cause we when hard
bag some niggas knew and some niggas didnt
aint fuck either way it was no bullshiting
Im cruddy niggas out to get money
And couple of slugs is the only thing anybody took from me
Run up on cat smooth like put it in his left ear
Give up the money the jewelry or get left here
Keep thinking its game well play lets get popped
See how much fun you having when your heart beat stop
Shut em down open up shop oh-oh no-oh blow off nigga top
Somebody call the cops but its to late
Cause Im hit you in the face
And what will kill you will be something that you ate

If pain is love , why hide my pain with drugs ?
Choke off haze and sell attics coke for days
Same clothes , no soap or shave
And still got gun on my hip for your open grave
We used to get robbery vics
Until my man got killed for his whip on some robbery shit
Then switched to the weed and start selling crack
But will pull steel and put shell up in ya back
feel like all my life was held up in trap
Like if go to heaven maybe hell will want me back
But all really want is ( unknown )
And model bitch sitting with head up in my lap
But since no dough dont spin
( unkown )
Its obvious live in house of sin
wish could open up the door and let em blow at the wind

Like the wind
God will take
All my sins
Blown away

The born loser , not because choose to be
But because all the bad shit happens to me
got kids , but their mothers dont want them to know me
Sisters used to like me but now they call me " homie "
Used to have family , now Im out on my own
Had to scrap with pit because tried to take his bone
Bitches dont like me , they dont kiss me or hug me
They call me " kill pretty " because Im mad ugly
used to get pussy , but busted off quick
Now gets none so gotta beat my dick
Times are hard in the ghetto , gotta steal for living
Eating turkey-flavored Now & Laters for Thanksgiving
If that aint enough , life is rough swear
dont have an address so cant get welfare
They kicked me out the shelter because they said smelled
Little like the living dead and looked like Helter Skelter
My clothes are so funky , theyre bad for my health
Sometimes at night my pants go to the bathroom by themself
Even when was little nothing went my way
got beat up and chased home from school every day
And despite the fact want all the brothers bees
On my report card , didnt get Fs , got Cs
But for those who choose to snooze
Cause was born with no hope , got nothing to lose

The born loser , title was branded with
Went to Liberty Island , and got stranded with
The Statue of Liberty , but they didnt really have to
Leave my black ass there until the day after
No time for laughter , this shits for real
Ribs are showing through my back cause havent had meal
In week , you can see bones in my hands
The raccoons beat me to the garbage cans
Im starving Marvin , and it shouldnt be like that
The only thing that Im carving is an alley cat
But sometimes in the daytimes dream of Manwich
But all Im really eating is an oxygen sandwich
For those that dont know , thats two pieces of bread strapped together
Or Ill have rain sandwich , depending on the weather
Born Loser caught up in the game
And aint even got nobody to blame

The Born Loser , yeah , that used to me my M-O
When couldnt get soul to listen to my demo
Doors shut in my face until started jamming them
Im behind the doors now and Im the one slamming them
did what had to to get where got
Though Ill admit what had to do was lot
gave it shot , and sometimes had to shoot
Catching vics just to get little loot
thought it was cute and didnt care who knew
Mess around , get in my way and Ill bag you , too
Cause was born to lose straight from the beginning
In the dugout because struck out the first inning
Winning was everything , thats why had to
Ask my man to find the loot , and he said " Id be glad to "
Now who needs major label ? We got our own
Im the Divine Master of the Unknown
Aint nothing changed , Im the same as before
When oppoertunity knocked just answered the door
Criminal at heart even though dont show it
was always winner but just didnt know it
Imma take it back to the shit talkin slick talkin
Slap nigga and call him my bitch and keep walkin
HALF YALL niggas is pussy
The other half of yall niggas is fake thugs so please dont push me
If we was in jail youll be in the pool playin in the air pressure
Leave you up on the stretcher nigga Im gon test you try your hand
When they carry you out Imma tie your man
But these cats aint built like your killed like
Blood gets spilled like poke nigga tonight
Bang bang HA ! It hurts

Cause Imma put in clip and youll get yours

Hair raised on my back get low and hitum
Stoped him dead in his tracks
Known damn well you aint known me what you said in the past
Dogs dont know nothin but bust that nigga
Dogs dont nothin but fuck that nigga
Dogs dont know nothin but suck my dick
When it comes to what happened dogs dont know shit
Did two years in one night
popped two pills in one flight
Two ears in one light , aiight , aiight
Thats what it is FOLLOW
Too many thick live niggas wanna SWALLOW
Follow my mans and them
And get popped with yo mans and them is what Im handin them
Its hot things , drop things , stop things , drop things
Lookin like nigga like hot wings


Been around the block did my dirt
Earl stiral put in work till it hurt
Ive seen less pussy in stripe club fuckin with yall niggas
That means all yall niggas
Most yall cats dont know what ruthless means
Will you be able to survive the truth Ive seen
Cats wouldnt be alive if you was on my team
But the truth is the ride is rough ya mean
Got me like GOD what the fuck

Back up the truck jump right the fuck out on niggas

And everybody know my style and niggas know that Im the best
When it come to doing this and be banging on my chest
And bang in the East and Im banging in the West
And come to give you more and will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know whats next ( lets go )
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go , dont try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin and hustlin and sendin in and gettin in
And we always gotta do it , take it to another place
Gotta taste it and gotta grab it
And gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne , better know gotta have it


Got bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi , pussy juicy
never gave fuck about hater , got money on my radar
Dressed like skater , got big house , came with elevator
Your girlfriend freak like Cirque Du Soleil

And my pockets right , and my diamonds white

Okay , okay
Is that right

Sen kalk , bir minik mikrofonunu getir
Bak jak burada mikrofonuna tak

We started in the Midwest
Now we bout to take it
All over the world , baby
This is the pinnacle
Yeah , Tech N9ne

Follow me , all around the planet , run the gamut on sickology
They could never manage , we do damage with no apology
Pick them out the panic , little manic cause gotta be
Gobble the track up like Im grubbin at Mama Nakas
Give me the top of hip-hop and watch him make em rock
With show-stopper , chakras popping off the ( Worldwide Choppers )
If you anybody , you notice it
Tech is the pinnacle , not an identical soul is it
Loaded cold as the polar get wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo it exploded the flow behold it cause when the motor spit
A-bi de-a , bi-de , never to get free of the real
Better ya just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels
Hit em up and get em up , aint done , aint did enough
Trip when rip it up , be the ish when split em up
Sort of like was liquored up and backing up in the gut
Everybody be knowing be acting up when bust
From Missouri to Canada , be keeping the stamina
If you never been fan of the man , the planets unanimous
Can cuss , fuck anybody Tech is calamitous
Leave them in the dust , aint nobody tough when Im standing up
Tech is hostile , hes awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You with it , you dig it , you never lost the apostle
Hes thinking he give it the Poe and toss in Picasso
Killing everybody off is the motto
And be the only chopper thats tossed in the brothel
You said its pathetic , my head is off in the taco
sped and you bled and you in the coffin when go

Im light years ahead of my peers
Want some , you can come bring it right here
Cant clown me , dont come round me
Bow down , was crowned when they found me

( . . )
Check it , Im ahead of em
Chop it up with the veterans
legend developing
Aint gotta tell him its evident
Gotta notice an elephant
None of you niggas relevant
Youre delicate , but loving every second of this

( Denmark )
ved hvad der kommer ud af min mund
Hanger med de vildeste gutter
Det minder mig om vi stikker det af
For de kalder mig alle vild " Fucking Chopper "

( Alabama )
What if ran into you with pogo stick
Hopped up on top of you rappers like Jehovahs Witness
With photo of Jesus and paper pamphlet
And threw up more churches like was playing Hamlet
Syllable burning , that internal damage
Swing , batter , batter , but then lay back on hammock
Under an oak tree , like was peeling pecans
But instead , Im peeling rappers heads , making sand-a wich
Pick up 22 and put bullet inside of
Motherfucka from inside 1987 box
Im headed up , yeah , headed for bucks
Fuck em all , make them feel my dread like had head of locks
Feel every bump like you had bad shocks
But hopped on the fucking beat
And worldwide chopped
Wanna fuck with Tech N9ne
Twist up the pine and
Smoke beat with Mr . Busta Rhymes
Well , sure , why not ?
Really dont need to show any more of my cock
But run across the stadium in pair of your socks
In trench coat with the pencil and watch
Then drop verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up , beat it up , then gotta go
But Im dump truck , just send another load
Peter Piper dump pile of peppers in your throats
Wit an alien probe


Twista ( Chicago )
Like gotta focus up in my rhythm or loosen the venom
And hit em and give em astig-a ma-tism
And then Imma spit em somethin so full of vengeance
That everybodyll wanna devour the pieces of my enemies cause of cannibalism
Breaking them off into particles , they get in predicament
That be never reversible cause nigga be too versatile
Makin you nervous , you could never compete with the colonel
burn you , Im an immortal , and thats the reason murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make likkle magic
After wreck and check ya , then your respect better have
Because Im an anomaly , able to give lobotomy
To any motherfucker challenging my astronomy
Im one of the most popular choppers and my names known
Throwing it up in the air , takin it there
We WWC , if you cant keep up , shouldve stayed home
My alien knowledge be making other astronomers
Work look as ancient as discovery of paleontology
So play me and Imma be shining on them haters
Im finna be using it as energy , watch how radiant Imma be
Like helicopter when the words fly
Entire families all the way out to you girl die
If catch you fuckin with the most intricate lyricists
Dont even try to stop us cause we choppers and we worldwide
And Im


( New York )
See , now they ask when Imma stop it , my dude
And when Ima cock it and pop it , and when Ima drop it my dude
Inevitably , its that Imma be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together , my dude
Well , Ima be chopping and cutting and breaking and beating and shaking
And fucking everything up til there aint no further mistaking
And busting everything up like fuckin angry Jamaican
And shutting everything up , especially the ones who be hating
They loving everything until got em stuttering-stupid
You hear em now ?
P-P P-Please
Wh-wh wh-why you gotta t-try us
And now Imma come and kill em , get them , hit them , and finish them
And bang em in the head and diminish them , and then Ill
Hit em again at minimum , repeat it coming to killing em
Then he be gotta be drilling them
Spitting lithium , see the way nigga be spilling them
And getting them stupid to the point where theres no forgiving him
Hoping youre listening and youre paying attention
And youre witnessing the way that be crushing the mic
And getting in the zone , be flattening and packing in
People from the front to the back and
They got me acting fool , Im Black and


( Kansas City )
My fire annihilate make fighters retire instantly
The way be killing em with rhythm , it get illegitimate
The Gilla will finish any , in predicament
Any enemies in the vicinity , gotta mack up
They know they never can get with me whenever they mention me
The history of lyrical criminal more deadly than chemicals

( California )
hit em with venom when get up in em
bend em and send em and you can feel me
Digging up in your brain and bringing the pain
They often wanna kill me
Filling em with that fury
Get up and hurry , you can feel the Real me
Coming in with that shit , Im having fit , and you will never peel me
Off of you when Im on top of you , got the drop on you

Turn my mic up
Turn my mic up

Oh my lord , lower the casket down
Sprinkle the ash , or get your ass kicked , pow !
Frown while shit on your crown , skip town
Ground zero , shapiro the king cash cow
Do make em say Wow ! , strip , ow , bow

Blow , click , click , pow , click , pow
Stop traffic dropping them classics , flip now
( rawr , rawr , rawr ) let me come and mop up the knock offs
When pop off and never stop , cause
When we do come through , you better lock doors ( PAUSE )
The wolves wanna eat , peep how they lockjaws
No need to cook up the coke , you see we cop raw
And clipping they nails and dribbling and witness them
Nibble them like sunflower seed shells
Set these scales got my weight up heavy like three whales
Nigga your tree fell
See how they Twitter , Facebook and Instagramming email
Oh see well , these niggas already know
The way that fuck shit up , minus the details
The case is shut
Your bitch remind me of replacement butt kind of an ancient slut
Its going down like she was basement fuck
So gracefully and graciously , painfully wake niggas up
Ragdolling these niggas and attacking like apes in the cut
Missiles fling while spit live wire
With more fire for me to melt brick surfacing back sound
While light up shit thatll cause quick
Worship and gatheraround , its
Shameful the way shatter , split shit apart , it doesnt matter ( rip )
Your head up off your shoulders ( with ) bullets bigger than boulder
Like baking vomit and rabies cake like pastry bitch
( We that sick )
While bite the beat up and Im starting to heat up , yack
Back to the hood and off to the wild
And been blacking out so long niggas is asking if the hook had died
Naw , but the beat is fried !


Apparently theres light contagiousness to this tirade
It just might make you sick
So irate with this my brain is just like fucking fried egg
Is my mind scrambled ? Cause Im lit , narrow minded
But go through such wide range of this emotion
That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
just pulled up in Clive Davis driveway
With his personal memoir saying hes bi
Waving nine , picket sign , egging his ride
Making him cry " rape " then arrive naked
And drive straight through the gay pride parade , yippee-Ki Yay
Cause here wait , did the world just pee on my leg ?
And should take it as sign ? Maybe to take em back into time ( Shady )
stuck out like sore thumb , so gave em the finger
To take the attention away from my stinking face it was bringing
Changed the whole complexion of the game
But just in case you was thinking
An inkling of replacing the kingpin
Of crazy , youre wasting your ink then
So if this is any indication of what you may be facing
You better make distinction cause you fake imitations
Are leaving bad taste , fuck making bad impression
Thats the worst impersonation Ive ever seen and
Who raps nasally , eyes hazelly , rhymes crazily
But sounds like he may need some Flonase when hes speaking ?
What kind of stupid question is that ?
Hey Mrs . Abraham Lincoln
Other than your husbands fucking brains that were leaking
Howd you think that play was this weekend ?
You aint the real Slim Shady , sit your ass down faggot
See me on ballot ? Im running for class clown
Rich Democrat , bitch , so Im just candidate
To come fuck up the whole party
Me and Flipmode starting campaign
To have every campus on fucking rampage
Act my goddamn age ? am eight
So lets get smashed and wake up the next day with the room trashed , covered in Band-Aids
Glass ashtray smashed , champagne splashed on the lampshades
But this aint up for debate , this is undebatable
Shady for president , ho
Dont make me go take it back to the days of old
Where Sway & Tech radio when was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
almost fell asleep on the wake up show
Fuck you telling me , fools ?
was rippin shop raisin hell up in Drews
When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
Me and Bus put it down like sick pet
Youre fucking with vets dawg , fucking internet bloggers
" sit in front of my computer all day and comment on
Everything , Im an expert on everything , everything sucks , play the next song "
Guess if hopped out your freaking laptop , you idiot prick
With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you , Id be dead wrong
Son of God Im the . . . like wet log , pores never get clogged
Im so full of self-esteem that sweat fog
Step off forr you get stepped on , soft ?
Bout as commercial as my fucking Lear jet
Alert , alert , girl , alert
Once you enter in my house of pain , youre in world of hurt , so
Jump around , jump , jump , get that ass shaking
Jump around , jump , came to hit you with fan favorite
But if you too fly for coach better get them arms and freaking hands flailing
And jump like Van Halen , and pray for damn tailwind
More afraid of success than am of failure
So what does that tell ya ?
Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
Before he ran straight into the damn railing

Chill , man , chill
Big man , when talk , ere weh yuh fi do

When get down disappear , reappear and blow up
Everywhere , fucking with these flavas in ya ear

She pulled my rap sheet , just like , Neo Geo

Hahahaaa ! always roam through the forest
Just like brontosaurus , born in the month of May
So my sign is Taurus , kick you in your face
Like my fuckin name was Chuck Norris , make you sing my chorus
Rock to the beat and then , turn into walrus
You remain nameless , my victory remains flawless
Acting like you wild , but know you really harmless
While your time is coming , make the fat shit regardless

Many niggas wanna know when the Ramp return
Yo Im gettin phone calls from that nigga Howard Stern
He wants to know about my Flip Mode click
The way we get down and BUST NIGGAZ SHIT
LP after LP , we make Gs
run up in your ganks den take you for your keys
Im not lying or joking , you get broken
Dead in Flatbush , back to Roanoake and . . .

People always askin me , how your shit be sellin
For makin shit guaranteed to bust your fuckin melon
Police throwed me up on charges like was felon
There was no tellin , when was strikin had you swellin
Cruisin in my Lands , watch the police how they be gellin
Lock you up for days and got nigga ass smellin
Yo FUCK THAT ! You best believe there aint no time for dwellin
If you aint makin noise you need to kill the fuckin yellin

Chorus One
Chorus Two

Yo , yo , yo run up in your set like New York city . . .
cant slip , beat you down with my vice grip
Youre lost , that means you way off course
No remorse , Im gettin five in The Source

be saddleback biting motherfuckers like horse
Turn and toss , niggas all up in my applesauce
Watch me reinforce , my shit feel good like intercourse
Ever since was shorty rockin Hugo Boss

Aiyyo Bust Bust ( why ) you just made my day
If you didnt put me on Id be locked like .
Now Im writin rhymes hittin shorties everyday
In the full runnin drinkin ice Tanqueray
dont eat pork take fish fillet
Now Im knockin out niggas from . . to . . touche !
Now Im goin back around the way
Im rippin shit , like my name was Marvin Gaye

Yo , now Im back with more Bionic like my name was Colt Seavers
Got you niggas open like bunch of wide receivers
Time is on the meter , go clean your act up in the cleaners
Chickenhead , give me some of your chicken fajitas
Yo beg your pardon , write my rhymes way past the margins
Squeeze the Charmin , peace to one million men marchin
When you talk shit you really dont know what you startin
Now your shit is done like fuckin empty milk carton

Its on for the nine-six , mad shows at the Ritz
Now we got you open like Vicks
Stickin to your stomach like Quaker Oat Grits
Fisherman hat with my brand new kicks
On the low , still rock my Girbauds
See the show , got my nickel plated fo-fo
All my rough niggas open the do
Cause Boy Scout brings the ruckus and Im still hardco

Yo , when walk streets you know my blades little sharper
Fuck Peter Parker , cross you like magic marker
Everytime hit always hit little harder
Blazing to the point where niggas look little darker
Catching suntans from my music , fans understand
Making fat shit , always love to lend helping hand
Organized rhyme unit like the Poison Clan
While your ride is busted , be your luxury Sedan
Number one nigga in the chain of command
Breakin fool in school like my nigga Geechie Dan
Aiyyyyyo , see intruders on my scan
Singin at your funeral like Bobby Bluebland

Chorus One
Aiyo , Shallah , what up ? ( Yeah , you know how we do it )
( Turn me up , kid , lets get it popping )
Crazy , lets go get em killa ( Yo Dre , good looking on this coke , man )
( This shit is official )

Aiyo , its back to business , making them diskettes , pushing sixes
Rocking wild animals on jackets are sickening
Hear me ? From here to Rockaway to Cali , we flipped this
Broad day , Chefll saute , his lyrics is crispy
Now got Dre up in the kitchen , Rae stuck in position
Bout to flame broil his coke and get busy
What ? Politics , pop collars and drive violent whips
Stay fly , hungry and wise , you know the code , honor it
Sit back , yelling its nothing , unless his buttons get pressed
We dont stress nothing , we only get dressed
Stretched out , moving professional , frying more fish
heard it in slurs , them niggas is blessed
While we ball to the maximum , give me the floor , for real
show off and let my money get stretched
Take it to new level , new bezzle , few rebels
Few wolves with medals on , you know we get test

Me , nigga , me , thats who , Cash Rule
( Hah , better slow it down , niggasll smash you , homey , uh )
Me , nigga , me , pass through , rascals
( Hah , half gorilla , half ape in them track suits , black , come on )
Me , nigga , me , capsules , birds , whips
Ounces and fifths ( no licking the glass , duke , yeah )
Yeah , yea-yea yeah , yea-yea yeah , yeah ( yeah )
Im here , so its there , yea-yea yea-yeah , yeah

Here comes the , lethal presentation taking you places you never been
Deadlier than the combination of coke and heroin
see the weakness in most of you niggas that be hollering
So toned it down , so these words be piercing your lower obdomen
What meant to say abdomen , keep on listening and following
While Im ditecting German , hateful niggas , chicks be swallowing
And if you look funny to me , and theres problem then
put you under an ultraviolet light or halogen
As if was busy deciphering counterfeit dollars and
Hoes in like some kind of Biblical figure , King Solomon
Hah , just for the record , what we do is essential
While captivate the masses and keep the moments eventful
Doc Dre , Bust , Shallah Rae , see the vision ?
Most you niggas still in disbelief , just came into fruition now
Pop the cork up off this bottle and you pour it
So euphoric , document this moment , shit is so historic


King of kings spit blood , all on my apron
Wash niggas face with the MAC , smoke them like Steak Umms
Yeah my dynastys brolic for real , we hunt , eat , catch the rat
Blow his waist , float in the stream
You know we all-pro with it , anti auto-tune
Boom , my flow fire , sit by the stove , hit it
Real niggas , official as listeners , gangstas and visitors
Step in the shit , we all prisoners
Might take the hammer from you , know Im the animal
Rock spur fur hat , no niggas in sandals , boo
Everyday get money and dress rugged , these are the times
Keep nine on you , blow off in public
And will surely feed my niggas the streets
Cop the hottest things to get , and haters they can eat and then preach
And while it go down , worldwide , this the team , this the theme
Me , Dre , Rhymes , my money makers is mean , what ?

Intro / Chorus :

Whos on the microphone ? BUNCHA NIGGAS ! ( repeat 3X )

Wreckin it swift , Im tellin ya to heck with tell to get with the
Crazy hairy thinkin drinkin cripple drunken monkey

So peak , its about to get deep , we just kick
Your Third Eye right open dont let your eyeball sleep

Save yourself the trouble step back black , and dont even bother
Word to Shop and Swift they get called in like Im your father

Chorus

Aiyyo , its time for me to flow and get down with this
Im pullin out my mic , spittin off some rounds to this

Cause when Im flippin , Ill be rippin your pride out
So called gangsters play roles like in the movies
Oughta save that , theyre way bad , you could never do me
Im real as they come , Ill beat ya numb with my vocal tones
Words hit like aluminum bats to your dome
No charges against me cause Im jumpin the law man
A-men , punks should cancel their plans
As the invincible principle Gang , is gettin bigger
Sayin peace to the Heavster rollin with buncha niggas

Chorus

bring drama like ya , spit on my momma
Cannibalistic , like that nigga Jeffrey Dahmer
Ima head peeler , girl stealer
Coffin sealer , ex-drug dealer , HUHHHHHH !
When hit you with the blow of death leave nothing left
cook you up so quick they call me Biggie Smalls the Chef
My burners in my left , Im not the type to fight
Im blowing up quick like stick of dynamite
So call nine-one one , Biggies got gun
The gat to your back , Im smoking everyone
Quick to pack , quick to squeeze on the trigger
Whos in the house ? HUHHHHHH ! buncha niggas !

Chorus

Like yo , beg your pardon , whoa
When put one to the head nuff funk shit startin
Fine , so headline for the public
Get mine for my rap subjects
Packed with potential , wisdom versatile elements
To quench your sense , get down so feel the mental
Rhyme pro Im Rob-O , the super spectacular
Brown skinned junior from Africa
Blowin up so its , possible to freak
See the highlight , in fly writing , dont give [ fuck ]
split when its through then its get with the Guinness brew
And give shoutout to my Uptown crew and still Im wreckin

Chorus

Yo , here go , here go , here comes the man again gain
Ruff with pad and pen , so run go tell your friends
Its the big belly babalu boogaloo big , boy
And got plenty honies theres no need for no sex toy
Free me , slavery , let me go oh no no no
No longer will you treat my beautiful sisters like theyre filthy hoes
Never ran from static men to crew get dramatic
And get crazy respect from crazy crews with automatics
Now push could come to shove because they love the way flip skip
And thats what keeps me kinda popular with all the honeydaps
So look at me now , and tell me who is bigger ?
When Im on the block Im with my flock and Im rollin with buncha niggas

Chorus

Well HELLO HI ! HELLO HELLO ! How ya doin ? !
HI ! Hello hi HEY , how ya doin ? ! Voltronic !
Busta Rhymes comin with the mad ultrasonic
Esophagus to rock it , wreckin niggas need to stop it
You get your style busted thats just what they get for comin
You want some ? ! Yes know you want some of the TALENT !
But you can juice up , and em-otionally get wicked
To stick it , in your inner groove watch nigga kick it
Ohh hah ! Yo Bee , Busta Rhymes
Be my niggan , never muggin , only lovin and huggin
My niggas , as we get bigger we come diesel
As masculine figures , . . . . we gettin thicker with buncha niggas !
YESS !

Chorus 2X
Ayo Kayslay , Papoose ( huh )
finna cook some shit in the kitchen with yall niggas
Lets go

Busa Bus and Papoose will come and really hurt this
fuck you niggas up , see none of you niggas serve purpose
hook on niggas like Kareem and jail em like Julius servants
See these niggas powerless on how we reemarges
So deserving of the title , crown it , whatever you call it
And though you niggas was havin fun , see we come to spoil it
Treatin niggas like the shit they are , flush em down the toilet
Bitch see you cant afford it , see Im advising you to forfeit
Gotta come up off it , homie what you doin aint that importent
See we dont need what you got plus the street dont want it
Yo Pap come get these niggas and slap them across the face
With some more venomous rap , spike the strappers up on our waist
When we in the place , know you know he we do this nigga
If you think you new muthafucka , Im the newest nigga
With the newest money , with the newest album , the newest label
The newest cars , cribs , roll chains , used to call them cable
New commercial landscapes , get me new stable of bitches
Their thoroughbreds , Im meticulous and very anal
About how Im gonna strike and attack you cus Im able
And give it to you niggas back and white like Im interracial
And continue to keep it lyrical just to make them hate you
Sometimes make me so cynical until come and stick you
Stick pitch fork in em , watch while come to take them up
To another level , if you sleep , we came to wake em up

See you might get blister when we give you the heat
Better address me as mister , see me in the streets
Mr . Papoose , Mr . Busa Bus , this is grown man shit
Repect niggas like they born with it
The hood they always talk with it ( you hear them talkin about us ? )
But we the top rank , flawless in our weight class
You niggas dont really want problems , see every time we come with it
Shit is obvious , you muthafuckas straight ass

Papoose , you can call me Mr . Clientele
My mixtapes make more sales the Nextel
aint hard to find , they know where dwell , hell
Never been chubby niggas , Im skinny like twelve 12s
You had that cocaine for so long it smells stale
make hell sales , my caine GOAT like LL
Rip the smif wessun with quick aggression
And get the reppin , rip the niggas neck in
Bang his head in and cave his chest in less than sixty seconds
Spit the weapon through his intestines
Hit the exit , cant get arrested , its pig infested
Got sick obsessions , for walking in niggas sessions
make illest efforts to disrespect em with different gestures
My wisdom threatens these wicked peasants with ill intentions
He said he was laying in the cut , but shits infected
got disprefected , am the sheppard , so spin the record
Im representin for this profession ressurrected
Im giving belssings within the lessons of his intentions
This is the essence of my lyrics brethren , Busta Rhymes is living legend
dont know what you acting like youre heartless for
When you know that youre target like the department store
Cus Justo gave me the crown , and yall knew it
My songs ruthless , your bars truthless , its all foolish
Fill you with embaldment fluid , this is ex con music
Im like the Van ? ? ? , Ill show you how con do it


Blood on the Chefs hatchet , Im here for the action
Kill hundred niggas with aspirins and piss in they caskets
4-5s rip through your glasses , all mine , Mr . Gymnastics
Gimme more time , or visit the blasters
Cus Im starving , hungry for classy , Im dead up your lassy
See its nothing , press few buttons , the citys diasaster
Ayo anthrax em and axe em with sianide acid
Choke em out , escape in the cold and left through Lake Placid
Stop fronting , know you pastor , you know Im master
Im like six sixes in traffic , you niggas is taxes , hardbodies come
Through jurassics
Its all about mausberg lugers , loadin them rachets , blow them like napkins
Cus Im elevated at the top of my flowest power
The m-o stay young , fly , and rish like ? raw child ?
With transaction , grandmaction , niggas on the stove maxin
Throw thousand birds off the road , while my soldiers catch it
Playin all the lobbies , the Gottis the red Mazaratis
My colleagues will blow something , show you Karate
We know the code , pot , and parties , the live section
Keep him on his toes , take off them chromes and pass them to mami
Cus the feds around us , watchin us , ? Gottis ? is everybodys laundry
We could prbably get more if we hunting , probably
We hang niggas , bang pistols , take piece of your finger
Same whistle , you better respect it cus my name sizzle

Aiyyo , balls your pencils
As hollow tips get in you
Bots cutting to slice your face you
Rhymes is natural
Hold two lives and four wives
Up in the crack capsule
Flipmode cruddy styles has been past you
Rush pass
You couldnt touch cash
If it was under your nose
Like mustache
Nigga
What ass
Show your whole cheek
Slugs with no heat
Diamonds that dont break
You thugs is so sweet

float so much get seasick
Flipmode is the Squad who beez with
Who get plucks with
And push German Vs with
Rampage Im psychic can see shit
To the next millenium
You not gon be shit
Scratch your name off the list
Cut your wrist
You know the issue
Im official
When you die none of your niggas is really gon miss you

Chorus :
FLIPMODE SQUAD
Here to drop bombs
AGAINST ALL ODDS
Still remain gods
GRIP YOUR ARM
We always come hard
THE WORLD IS OURS
Call National Guard

Here we go
Any bitch that rhyme wanna flex she ass
Im stomping all things like Im plexi-glass
Niggas make way like when they hear sirens
Treat you like park and too close to fire hydrants
All up in the board
Kicking back long islands
Get your wig split first solid defiance
Rah Earth and sun in this Imperial alliance
You do the science

Im getting money shitting , turn intruders into vixens
Fall off beeper uh-uh niggas stay getting
Dirty nigga for life
Thats how Spliffs living
Throwing niggas in caskets
Tired of yellow ribbons
buck my duck if you touch my one
Rather Jamaican than belly boy make you people for fun
Fat Mans Son , street educated
The colonel of ghetto jurors , still thug related

Chorus

We enemies of three strike felony laws
Gorilla dicking K-Y jelly for whores
Lapdances trap grands without laws
My baby moms , three eighty for your arms
That bust with loud force
The ghetto with us
That bang Makaveli in trucks
That whatever the fuck to give cheddar in chunks
Who gazey chase
Fake thugs with lazy aid
Track marks
Rap stars
And rain of aids

Yo , what you want from us
Now visualize more of us
Stay toting under my given flavor from Nauticas
Destroy every arch rival or any challenger
Make you remember this day
Nigga mark it on your calendar
Im showing you something
You aint saying nothing
My niggas make noise
Like bunch of volcanoes erupting
None of yall niggas really wanna war
The type of nigga to crash my plane in your building
In the name of Allah

Chorus
All do is win , win , win , no matter what
Got money on my mind can never get enough
Whenever me and Khaled do the remix everybodys hands go up
And they stay there
And they stay yea
And they stay there
Up , down , up , down , up , down
Cause all do is win , win , win
And if you going in put your hands in the air make em stay there

Sittin on the top floor , what you think Im hot for
Every summer drop more , hits to make my stock go , up
Them hands go , up ; them fans go , up
Im number one in this bitch and Ima , stay there
We the best of the best , grind while you haters just sleep
Im yellin " free Weezy " , rep the heart of the streets
Who hotter than me , Im wearin the crown
We cant stop , wont stop ; go hate on me now

could never get enough when it come to gettin fetti
Niggas aint ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti
Mario Andretti , money comin fast
My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass
could never be racist , wake up every morning just to count white faces
Neo in the Matrix , glorious as Morpheus
Employed all warriors , Im mean as scorpion , Dr . Kevorkian

Everytime come you gotta know nigga comin
Get lot of money when Im in the buildin
And come and say there aint nobody better , better , better
Uh-huh , Okay
Niggas know got you when hit you with the pitter-patter
Whenever they see me then you hear lot of chitter-chatter
Niggas know there aint nobody , better , better , better
watch lot of niggas when Im in the cut
So sick when come and hit em in the gut
You will crown me king ( no matter what ! )
Ok lets shine my friend
Get up on my grind again
Some niggas will be happy that chose to rhyme with them cause


Her heart racing like she snort cocaine
got billion reasons you should know my whole name
Got the most paper Mr . New York Times
Im natural born winner nigga New York mines
Everybody getting money but cop the first six
Now run the game so toss the first pitch
Yea , Ill let you wife her but she still my first bitch
If its less then nine digits nigga , that aint fuckin rich mother fucker

Ayo , all do is win , aint that the reason that you really mad
Undisputed hailing all the way from Trinidad
aint mad ma , see you on your bummy swag
Im in that money green Jag , lot of money bags
told Khaled you the best but Im the bestest
Better run for cover if your name is on my checklist
You could talk slick , all the way down to the welfare
Ask the IRS bitch , Im paying for your health care

Ima make this here official , Let me clear some issues
First off am not for Britney Spears initials
Thats no B-S , at your re-quest
Lean back you and your crew , Fat Joe , T-S
Yea its Young Funeral , all black on me
So act like summers over and fall back homey
Winnin is all do , Ill answer all of you
But yall aint sayin shit , like prank callers do


Its already proven , got them birds movin
All do is win , Im allergic to losin
Yellow gold cuban , nine mil Ruger
Ill show you what to do with em
Finish em , Im through with em
They gon have to jump me , its gon take few of em
They dont want no problems , they might end up suing em
Disassociate yourself , have nothing to do with em
We already got jet , we tryna get two of em

Just blew trial , crack lobsters Little Italy
Your wife she screamer yellin slow down Joe , you killin me
You just hit the Power Ball , everyday new toy

Ridin through Harlem me and Jeezy pardon me
Puffy surfin on the hood for niggas that keep doubtin me

While use stacked chips and count Arab money now

Yo , it all began like , bust it
My nigga City bout to bounce on trip
We met some niggas with alot of things they want em to flip
told my nigga get the dough and keep the blau on your hip
Travel safe , you know that Imma hold it down on the strip
Good lookin , word to mother son give you my wit
But when get back , Imma bounce straight to your crib
On the strength , son slid until you to the Greyhound
Wit burner in the knapsack , headed straight outta town
Now , three days pass Im still on the strip
Doin hand to hand with twelve collapsible , stashable clips
With little magnets on the side of the clips we planted like project
When police come we stick the clips in any metal object
Throwin nigga on the walls and try to search me down
laugh knowin that my stashll never be found
Well anyway , on the third day , son came straight to the strip
Wit new floss and shiny shoes on the whip
My nigga hit me with the latest , greatest
He told me get inside the whip so can know just what the up to date is
He said he fuckin wit some Guyanese niggas how ill them niggas is
What kind of dough they get , and how they handle they biz
How they connect with Jamaician niggas who speak American
And how they chains swung medallion iced out pelicans
And how they stay wit four pounders
And speak American to try to blend in
Like they aint obvious out of towners
Okay , Ive never heard of workers gettin five Gs pay
For trips that last for only 2-3 day
How these Guyanese niggas be eatin pasta but they love zucchini
Rockin valor tennis suits by Sergio Tecchini
Them type of cats that call you because you cant call em
Rockin baseball fitters with wild animal skins on em
How they rock silks and tailor made pants
And get matching bally shoe for the silk to step in the dance
Washrags hangin from every one of our back pockets
] From every fine wine to champagne them niggasll straight cop it
And set up shops in them neighborhoods that was residential
Rock laced whips while the workersll floss the latest rentals
How they fuck with arrogant bitches who act pussy
And love to hustle wit niggas and stash coke up in they pussy
After all of that wanted ones
The way my nigga was talkin so next trip went to bounce with son
So now we out of town with Guyanese cats
Up in they gates bubbling packages and layin wit gats
Shit was slow until the main fiend was offed
Just like thief in the night
And spread the word that we was back with the white

" Ayo why dont you tell that crackhead to close the fuckin door
And shut the fuck up "
" Yeah man and clean the motherfucking spot up , smell like . . . "
" Break the fuckin breakdown in the working city . . . yo go get the plates
And the gym star "
" Yo light that up , lemme hit that , gimme light , yeah man cut that "
" Fuck this shit "

Yeah , see how we blowin pa
The lookout niggas holdin fort like they was watchtowers
Buggin on how we went through , half brick every couple of hours
So on and so on , shit is good and we eatin
First nigga to short package will catch the most brutal beatin
The whole town , see we now own it
Carryin on and blemishing all in the hearts of the best moments
We stackin cheddar now and shit is all clear
And we was growin as workin niggas wit aspiring ideas
We love to floss and the feeling of pushing chrome shit
But in the grand scheme these niggasll love to have they own shit
Now these niggas was really ready to swell up
We decided to separate from them niggas and make our shit develop
Off in to the wilderness of the wicked Husid
We set up shops and watched the games begin
So now we ballin like motherfucker , money was sick
Gas on the cheddar and these bitches ridin the dick
Fuckin everything from the local McDonalds bitches with the biggest ass
To attorney bitches thatll beat charge fast
We used to takin niggas custies and leave they set up on tilt
And watch em angrily scheme on the shit that we built
Aint it funny how shit transpire in fact
Not too long after our ride we took the winners stash , house was at
Some niggas tried to run jook with things in they palm
Not problem so immediately reach for the john
Right away the gun BUST ! straight lifted nigga
How we moved his organs with kickback , shifted nigga
Wild shots fire , everybody scatter like rats
Leavin nothing but gunpowder and trail of smoke in these gats
Now we got this faggot nigga blood on our hands
But fuck it , determined to fulfill the best of these plans
Shit was hot but we was nowhere near ready to fall
My son said he shot , but he wasnt bleeding at all
Word , started buggin when my nigga said he feel cold
Then looked up on the right side of his shirt and found little hole
So as we continue to radically blaze the fifth
Flame the iron , not giving fuck , yall niggas wanna rip ?
Well we deaded three out of the four niggas who tried to jook
One nigga slid and think he got off the hook
Now let me find out one out of them three niggas we bodied
Was one of them Guyanese niggas who buy drinks up for the party
He was the nigga to flood the table with champagnes
Stupid motherfucker tried to front , we had to leak his brain
Suddenly my nigga fell to the floor
And said his legs feel like them shits aint got no feelins no more
More the actin up the more the shit felt in my gut
The shit was all over as soon as the director said CUT !

Thats wrap , good actin motherfuckers , good actin
Thats the shit Im talkin about
Yall ready to watch the playback ?
Fuck around , that shitll be box office smash motherfuckers

Soldiers get up , faggot niggas need to sit down , what ?

Ball in the club , now Im drunk havin bad dream
This muhfucker tried to greet me with wealth

This nigga was eagerly waitin to prove it
Astonishingly , already dancin to his own burial music
Well anyway , he plottin to do it to me
In certain kind of way , and started off directly poppin shit to me
While he spoke couple of fires would spark
While he sat in the shadow talkin his shit we watched the sky gettin dark he said

Well isnt you ( ? ) where it hurts , Ill leave you in rock sample
Straight up leakin in the back of church
Then ghost ya crib and haunt you like ghost in your home
Leavin you old and decrepit like them ruins in Rome
Watch your body shrivel up and turn your ashes to smoke
Fuck your flesh dont get yo blood sucked , the blood of ya foes
be that nigga thatll torture your spouse
And leave thousand body bags like truth . com in front of your house

Got me buggin on whole nother level
Tell me how the FUCK nigga really end up havin beef with the devil
Shit bugged the whole effect the nigga had on my dreamin
Body reactin mentally , goin to war with the demon
Semi-chaotic like typical storm
So embellished in the dream nigga felt it in the physical form
The dream got my nose runny and shit
Eyes watery , shorty watchin my body twitch funny and shit
Givin shorty sleepin with me the creeps
She buggin off how nigga just sweatin and breathin so hard in his sleep
Determined to conquer this nigga so let it begin
Absolutely focused on killin the demon within
So now we fight in the name of my brethren
And every blow connect durin the fight you can hear the thunder roll into heaven
Inhale deep breath of fresh air
The devils presence blows cold draft leavin scent of death in the air
While my mind was reassemblin now
Simultaneous wifey watchin nigga body tremblin now
Couldnt conquer me so now the devil wanted me dead
Stabbed nigga with the same bone he ripped from his head
Yo its funny how the devilsll test us
But its only select , niggas blessed with somethin so miraculous and precious
Til Im dead Im always battlin through
You disbelieve then cut my main vein that all my blood be travelin through
Somebody got to die , settle the score
Because its me or this nigga , Im fighting to the death
Im ready for WAR ! ! ! ! ! !

You know that kid is coming , Cuban Linx , nigga
Louis Rich , the signature , bitch
( Every dog has his day , huh , Mel ?
You wanna job Ernie ? Ok , then , you call me tomorrow )
Been through the storm , through the cold and rain
Everythings still the same
Cant control how feel
Sometimes its hard to keep it real
You see the luxuries in life , with the fortune and fame
Like them Cadillacs with sunroofs mayne
So many ways to make dollar
Huh , sometimes think about my father
You see my poppa was broke , and my momma was young
Tryin to blend in with them city folk
Every day landlord knockin down my do
Wonderin where my next blessing is comin from

My momma and poppa , moved to the . . as Jamaicans
Struggled to get visas and green cards through immigration
Though my pop was po , stayed away from crime and malice
Hard living gave him hard hands and callous
As youngn , peep how much they loved each others space
His hard hands rubbin against the pretty skin of my mothers face
Dig for treasure til his hands looked like hands of junkie
So coarse , slap mule and take the life from donkey
On the other hand , mommy was the type to work two jobs
Never enough money , thats why got your whole crew robbed
Got older , developed ways of grippin the steel
Barely home for me to see her , or get good cooked meal
Seek refuge in the alleged land of the free , lookin
Blendin in with city folk , down in Flatbush Brooklyn
Feel little of my pain , follow and sing to it
Homey seen it all , if you aint knowin been through it
In other words


Got little older , late teens , me and my crew would huddle
On the corner late nights , plottin to escape struggle
Nights got cold and still would hustle in the same place
In front of Pancho Delis , now the freeze up on nigga face
1987 Reaganomics ever curious
To visit other cities , out of town kick was serious
Guayanese jeans bounce , put whatever slinger on
Whatever slinger came back , quickly brought me right along
Nigga ran away from home
Doin different wild shit , just to put pair of Filas on , Didas on
Wreck is all for the good , gettin into shit
Like we innocent , actin older than should
Walk around broke in the hood , watchin all the rich niggas
These younger thugs who try to choke and try to get niggas
Thinkin bout my mom and pop , while Im monopolizin
To hell with just gettin by and economizin
Its kinda hard bein humble in the belly of struggle
Doin things that probably get you in trouble
Thats why we stay up on the block , gettin money while we keepin it safe
In front of churchgoers keepin the faith
Mom and pop be worryin for they son
Despite they struggle and their honest livin look and see just what become
scavenger , in brute pursuit to be happy , another youngn thats wildin
Across the line until somebody tryin to cap me ohhhh shit { * gunfire * }

been through the storm
Through the cold and rain
Everythings still the same
Cant control how feel
Sometimes its hard to keep it real
Woooooooooooooo-whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yeahhhhhhhhhhh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Making of the Beat / Cam

[ Hook : Chance the Rapper ] ( x2 )
Cigarettes on cigarettes , my mama think stank
got burn holes in my hoodies , all my homies think its dank
miss my cocoa butter kisses
miss my cocoa butter kisses

Okie dokie , alky , keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or hell go blow the loudy , saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote , wilding like that coyote
If sip any Henny , my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside huggy , Starsky & Hutch dougie
just opened up the pack in an hour Ill ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling , " fuck me , " two weeks shell be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy , Tommy , and Chuckie
And Chuck . Cheeses pizzas , Jesus pieces , sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me , know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddys , yall taught me how to go hunting ( BLAM ! )


( Innanet )
will smoke little something but dont inhale
Everywhere that go , everywhere they be asking hows it going
Say the goings well , go figure , Victors light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell , all praise to the God
God knows hes pro , hes pro like COINTEL
Check , check mate , check me take me to the bedroom , let you know me well
mean normally , you see Norma Jean wouldnt kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days , they get so high , burn trees , smoke chlorophyll
Til they cant feel shit , shit-faced , faced it , 15 hits on this
Elevated , train , and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill , miseducated , my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy , they said shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad , enough of that jazz
Asshole , absynthe up in that glass
Are we there yet ? Ice cubes in bong
Rip , brain dead , take tug and then pass

think we all addicted
Yeah , think we all addicted
Really though , think we all addicted
think we all addicted

Cigarettes on cigarettes , my momma think stank
got burn holes in my memories , my homies think its dank
miss my cocoa butter kisses
think we all addicted


could make flow , pitter patter with patter pitter juicy
Used to be in jalabiya and kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to groupie
ended up on an album cover in Coogi
You see , be still God but goofy
You be flowing about drugs and Uzi
Thats the new principle , sometimes Imma be about some hoes
Sometimes Imma wanna make movie
And when it come to rapping fast , Im the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
could still break your body down to five pieces like did Voltron
Cause Im addicted to the craft and be off OG
Know me , Im the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits , methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like Im offa codeine , low key
Dont be so judgmental , even though Im reminiscing
If dont know what miss is
Ima end up figuring out that its home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that praise and Im thanking
need em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And wanna get hug , and cant cause Im stanking
Never too old for spanking , igh

Sen kalk , bir minik mikrofonunu getir
Bak jak burada mikrofonuna tak

We started in the Midwest
Now we bout to take it
All over the world , baby
This is the pinnacle
Yeah , Tech N9ne

Follow me , all around the planet , run the gamut on sickology
They could never manage , we do damage with no apology
Pick them out the panic , little manic cause gotta be
Gobble the track up like Im grubbin at Mama Nakas
Give me the top of hip-hop and watch him make em rock
With show-stopper , chakras popping off the ( Worldwide Choppers )
If you anybody , you notice it
Tech is the pinnacle , not an identical soul is it
Loaded cold as the polar get wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo it exploded the flow behold it cause when the motor spit
A-bi de-a , bi-de , never to get free of the real
Better ya just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels
Hit em up and get em up , aint done , aint did enough
Trip when rip it up , be the ish when split em up
Sort of like was liquored up and backing up in the gut
Everybody be knowing be acting up when bust
From Missouri to Canada , be keeping the stamina
If you never been fan of the man , the planets unanimous
Can cuss , fuck anybody Tech is calamitous
Leave them in the dust , aint nobody tough when Im standing up
Tech is hostile , hes awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You with it , you dig it , you never lost the apostle
Hes thinking he give it the Poe and toss in Picasso
Killing everybody off is the motto
And be the only chopper thats tossed in the brothel
You said its pathetic , my head is off in the taco
sped and you bled and you in the coffin when go

Im light years ahead of my peers
Want some , you can come bring it right here
Cant clown me , dont come round me
Bow down , was crowned when they found me

( . . )
Check it , Im ahead of em
Chop it up with the veterans
legend developing
Aint gotta tell him its evident
Gotta notice an elephant
None of you niggas relevant
Youre delicate , but loving every second of this

( Denmark )
ved hvad der kommer ud af min mund
Hanger med de vildeste gutter
Det minder mig om vi stikker det af
For de kalder mig alle vild " Fucking Chopper "

( Alabama )
What if ran into you with pogo stick
Hopped up on top of you rappers like Jehovahs Witness
With photo of Jesus and paper pamphlet
And threw up more churches like was playing Hamlet
Syllable burning , that internal damage
Swing , batter , batter , but then lay back on hammock
Under an oak tree , like was peeling pecans
But instead , Im peeling rappers heads , making sand-a wich
Pick up 22 and put bullet inside of
Motherfucka from inside 1987 box
Im headed up , yeah , headed for bucks
Fuck em all , make them feel my dread like had head of locks
Feel every bump like you had bad shocks
But hopped on the fucking beat
And worldwide chopped
Wanna fuck with Tech N9ne
Twist up the pine and
Smoke beat with Mr . Busta Rhymes
Well , sure , why not ?
Really dont need to show any more of my cock
But run across the stadium in pair of your socks
In trench coat with the pencil and watch
Then drop verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up , beat it up , then gotta go
But Im dump truck , just send another load
Peter Piper dump pile of peppers in your throats
Wit an alien probe


Twista ( Chicago )
Like gotta focus up in my rhythm or loosen the venom
And hit em and give em astig-a ma-tism
And then Imma spit em somethin so full of vengeance
That everybodyll wanna devour the pieces of my enemies cause of cannibalism
Breaking them off into particles , they get in predicament
That be never reversible cause nigga be too versatile
Makin you nervous , you could never compete with the colonel
burn you , Im an immortal , and thats the reason murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make likkle magic
After wreck and check ya , then your respect better have
Because Im an anomaly , able to give lobotomy
To any motherfucker challenging my astronomy
Im one of the most popular choppers and my names known
Throwing it up in the air , takin it there
We WWC , if you cant keep up , shouldve stayed home
My alien knowledge be making other astronomers
Work look as ancient as discovery of paleontology
So play me and Imma be shining on them haters
Im finna be using it as energy , watch how radiant Imma be
Like helicopter when the words fly
Entire families all the way out to you girl die
If catch you fuckin with the most intricate lyricists
Dont even try to stop us cause we choppers and we worldwide
And Im


( New York )
See , now they ask when Imma stop it , my dude
And when Ima cock it and pop it , and when Ima drop it my dude
Inevitably , its that Imma be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together , my dude
Well , Ima be chopping and cutting and breaking and beating and shaking
And fucking everything up til there aint no further mistaking
And busting everything up like fuckin angry Jamaican
And shutting everything up , especially the ones who be hating
They loving everything until got em stuttering-stupid
You hear em now ?
P-P P-Please
Wh-wh wh-why you gotta t-try us
And now Imma come and kill em , get them , hit them , and finish them
And bang em in the head and diminish them , and then Ill
Hit em again at minimum , repeat it coming to killing em
Then he be gotta be drilling them
Spitting lithium , see the way nigga be spilling them
And getting them stupid to the point where theres no forgiving him
Hoping youre listening and youre paying attention
And youre witnessing the way that be crushing the mic
And getting in the zone , be flattening and packing in
People from the front to the back and
They got me acting fool , Im Black and


( Kansas City )
My fire annihilate make fighters retire instantly
The way be killing em with rhythm , it get illegitimate
The Gilla will finish any , in predicament
Any enemies in the vicinity , gotta mack up
They know they never can get with me whenever they mention me
The history of lyrical criminal more deadly than chemicals

( California )
hit em with venom when get up in em
bend em and send em and you can feel me
Digging up in your brain and bringing the pain
They often wanna kill me
Filling em with that fury
Get up and hurry , you can feel the Real me
Coming in with that shit , Im having fit , and you will never peel me
Off of you when Im on top of you , got the drop on you
Superstar , man Im far from an average Joe , supernatural
Stepping out , looking like Im in fashion show
Came into this industry and now youre witnessing me blow up
Like seeing tank of gas explode
And Im , Im high like Im flyin sitting back of coach
By the window sipping Jack and Cokes
Bout to pack bowl but we aint tryna bake casserole
Looking at the globe from up high , shots fired
Like Kennedy was riding by the Grassy Knoll
aint rich but got little cash to blow
When haters saying that Im changing
Ill be looking at them laughing like they cracked joke
They wasnt with me when traveled down this gravel road
GC , could never have my pass revoked
So step up and you dead duck
Get your head bust , looking like chef just cracked yolk
Speakers in the Caddy rattling the patio
When the industry was only rocking platinum gold
was dope back then , but you had the whole
Shit locked until came and cracked the code
And dont , dont really mean to brag and boast
But then again , my fans look at me as the . . .
She said she listen to my music in the bath and soak
Now thats rap to quote , hop in my Lac and float
Ya Uh Yeah

Take puff and its up and away we go
Put some pimp shit on my radio and bounce , bounce , out
Let the bass vibrate my chest , take it to the Midwest
Brought it back to the south , and bounce , out

With my homie Tony footwork
Up in Kalamazoo , balling out up in the mall
We dont bounce til we spend couple thousand on shoes
Im repping clintel , how can lose , you out of the loop
These music dudes were clueless who was
Til blew , producing woohs and oohs and ahs
Im the truth , what you confused ? Are you surprised ?
refuse to lose , been booed and crucified
Disapprove the movement , crews get brutalized
If these pooches choose to bite , get euthanized
Im the new , the who is who gets neutralized
Twenty twos are huge , my shoes are supersized
Out on cruse , my music boomin stupid loud
Bumping Ball & MJG , from the outside looking in
Im sitting on top of the world , but then again kind of been lately
When pull up in my Cadillac , my speakers got that rattle back
Im flashin back to when was attacked by
couple pretty bitches that was begging me to pick em up
And take em in and fuck em from the back side
But aint got no time to fuck around , Im trying to buckle down
And focus on my money , so stack my
Paper to the ceiling , Im feeling like billion
Im filling up my cup with that crown and bounce out


Diamonds on my body , so appealin jottin down my feelins
Acting like it was the realest shit ever wrote
Mental telepathy is part of the recipe
That let me know that you want it
Im giving it to you how you like it
Biology of pimp , it be in the DNA
To know what you thinking
can make your life so appealing by the way write it
Make it so she the only shawty know
roll up one and light it
On the passenger side of ride
Like player , Imma be up in the club talking the big shit
Strange Music , we be the misfits
Come and twist Rittz , tisk tisk , cause you gon get your shit split
Middle of the map and nigga finna snap
And let em know the area continue to kill em forever , we on
Better be strong to live in the city come from
And we can either talk about it or be about it
When hear something like this up on the radio
All nigga can do is just bounce

And when come over and bend ya ass , you be bumpin Teddy Pendergrass

Now got to go up in it fast , but Imma finish last

And when some Luther come on hope you feelin me
And still will be in love wit me

From Champions to Slow Jammin , oh baby

Girl see you in them Apple Bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back , wanna know your name
Girl Im Twista , could blow your brains
Put you in chameleon 04 Range
Still sexy when you smoke that flame
Jerk it like chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so Im loving the way that she walk
You looking good , girl , you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me , see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime see your thighs cry when drive by
Watching you should be thrill , got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming " my , my , my , my "
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
can see your beauty on the big screen
can see me freaking you with whipped cream
can see you on stage at the awards
With dress better than Jennifers and doing big things
Kick it with me can mold your life
You looking good girl , show you right
Dre told me you the prototype
can make you celebrity overnight


You want fame , you can take that path
Candlelights fore you take bath
You got such sensational ass
Imma get you Jimmy Choo and Marc Jacob bags
can cop her 2003
Make her smile when she sees Spres
can get you on CDs and DVDs
Take you to BeBes and BCBG
can get you into places to be into
The people to know or show you things to get into
wanna be your lover and your confidant
And protect you from others , dont ever let brother pimp you
If you want the style , you can get ya girl
Yall take look at her , she got such an astonishing body
can see ya in some Gucci or Robert Cavalli
And bet she gon put hurt on em hard in the party
And you know you kill em in the club we go
You was born to be pro , how you know whos taking photos
And love you cause you freaky with the door closed
Drop it to the flo , let that go when you roll slow
And love it when hit it from the back
And you get on top of me and have brother going " oh-oh "
Girl love how you roll me right
can make you celebrity overnight


( * talking * )
You see , see baby girl
You see how you make brother break down
just gotta ask you , what you need
What you need from me , oh you wanna be star
Are you messing with the right one

Youve got all the finest things
Let me be your manager

Come here girl , could see you bored
Tell you youre the queen that see you for
Take you shopping on sprees in stores
Imma get you to the MTV awards

Come here girl , you could hang if you bored
We could do plenty things plus more
Im about to have you changin in stores

We about to do show tonight
You looking good girl , show you right
Take you places know you like
could make you celebrity overnight
Twista 2012 Lyrics ( feat . Tia London )

Tia London

If tomorrow the world ends
will stay here forever
Standing right by your side
You know they say ( they say ) that its all gonna end some day
So , right before it does ( right before it does )
If tomorrow was 2012
The last day on Earth , 2012
The end of the world , 2012

2012 [ x7 ]
Now they be telling me that these are the last days
Are we really that close to Armageddon
Hit the blunt after the world in the dim
Then you can get it in like the world fixin to end
But with such beautiful girl in the room
want to be up in you when the world go boom
Global warming is having major effect
Mother Earth is about to go to another cycle
And know that is about to end someday ( someday )
Right before it does ( right before it does )
Like tomorrow was 2012
The end of the world , 2012
The last day on Earth , 2012
2012 [ x7 ]

Twista

So only live to serve ya
The dark is about to devour the Earth
So come and ride with the Silver Surfer
Now will it all in from the element
Of ether or artificial intelligence
As long as we both have the passion
The sex it just makes all the issues irrelevant
So just sit back and blow my dro
( Right before it does )
Steady looking at the clock
Before we suffer let me make your body rock
2012 , The last day on Earth
2012 , The end of the world
2012 [ x7 ]

Niggas talkin bout Twista this Twista that

could ride on they ass like Buffalo Bill
be winnin in the game like them niggas in the south
And Imma make nigga sick cause got venom in the mouth
Antonyms and synonyms are spinnin him out of his route
Kill em with the ride paints hard with the deep dish
Kill em wit syllables quick wit bars in sequence
am the bidness gotta charge you to peep this
Stevie in the blackout see me with the Mack out
Twista gon get money like GD in crack house
When it come to flows Imma spit em like they cold
When it come to niggas heads Imma split it like pole
Take away they swag and shit on they cocky style
Cuz my lyrics be too quick they call me Twista Pacquiao
Niggas wanna get me they better pick new regimen
Shit too sick somebody better go get you medicine
Balls bigger than mine betta go get elephants
be getting grimy but you and yo click too elegant
Beat yo face up til yo jaw tissue look like pelican
be steady whoopin yo ass just fo the hell of it
kick hot flow , get it like Harpo
Brief when rhyme teeth shine like car show
Wit thick bitch , go head check out my cargo
You know one gon be wit me wherever my car go
Where yo baby at where yo white Mercedes
At ill let borrow the Bentley as long as you bring it back
Me and yo boss kick it and he know where the ladies at
Whether we comin and killin and murderin cause beat down the block
Meanwhile , back to the lab got the Desert Eagle
Come on your mothafuckin tip and kill lot of people
E-mail , anthrax , flows kick arsenic
Cut raw dope , these niggas cut garbage
Lethargic , give bitch hard dick
See my niggas and say " salute " like sergeant
So be passin out , fuck you flyers
To fakers and heaters and then fuck liars
am the shit need to wear diapers
Blame it on the Don Julio and killer tropical
Twista got more swag than rich sissy
Any niggas dat try to get me is finna get sprayed
Fucka . . . . fucka . . . . fucka . . . . fucka
See you with the eye
Rather at the apex of pyramid or the forehead of cyclops
Talking shit to me make sure youre off the right block
Still Imma come through in the Mercedes Benz white drop
Might stop , but only if know you dont mean to blow you with the statement
But dont be fuckin with these niggas , and thats why they be hatin
Cause stay in the zone , be alone , so excuse me if Im wrong
Im off kush , and when the . . . affect the dialect be as free as the wind and fire
Let the energy in me be my empire yet the remedy for me is ultraviolet , violence , silence
All the critics when spit it Imma creature of punishment when it comes to torturing
And with this rap shit Im beast
Balling like Im Uncle Pauly and all of the above we goin in the club incognito with the snub
East , be the direction that Im prayin in
But Im Midwest nigga
Mean with verse , something fly am seen with it first
So they can say " Where you get that nigga ? "
The essence of my vocabularys exquisite when enter into realm , taking me to the helm
Of lyricism , you gonna be callin me majesty , callin tragedy that you gotta see on film
So salute and advise you not to shoot , you are not equivalent or parallel to my level
Sub-par , So coming at me wrong is worse then being on the carousel with the devil
can turn these happy homes and these fake MCs into whole apartment buildings and vacancies
Bakeries , cook em til they done , whoop em til they wump , put funk in them niggas
Watch what you say to me

Dont play with me , Imma make hater pray to me
God cause Im hard and my flows is the coldest
You are no threat , dont step , am descendent of Imhotep , yes , Moses knows this
Of annihilation we are on brink , be smokin up the stink , so before somebody thinks
See see imma start to get ugly as Michael Spinks , when rap about the Sphinx , instead of about minks
Knowledge is power so he taught you bout your third eye

Type of shit make bird swim , fish fly
Fuck it , touch the sky on the first try
Man motherfucker could never control me , only squeeze me and hold me
Is what the ho came up and told me , Now is she bold ?
But in my mouth is where the gold be , cause be playin her like Goldy
Ab-Soul know ya know me
Pack of Backwoods jar of that good yeah blow it by the OZ
never sleep , you getting cozy
made it out the jungle , should write book about Mowgli
aint killer but dont push me
hit you with Sig , but Id rather smoke up on stogie
God MC , you could say Im holy
The ghost of Alori Joh walk with me so nigga never lonely
Solo ( Soulo ) , but Top Dawg is army
Flow AT and nigga gs
Might be the hip hop Bob Marley , Taking shots at politicians while roll weed
Easily Eazy-E without the Jheri Curl Juice
Off that drank that make you think every girl cute
On top of the pyramid , angles acute
Mark of the Beast on me , him , her , and you
Money in the safe in case theres lawsuit
Because any lumberjack would say they saw you
Me and Twista in the cut twistin up blunt what the fuck you want ?

{ Ladies and Gentleman } { * echoes * }

The B-O N-E we got plenty of flows ;
From Cleveland , Ohio we rollin on vogues
They told me this record was only for pros
So Layzie gon get in . . . suppose
Foes slammin them Cadillac dos
My story they caught has never been told
Sit back while Im tellin this thuggish we blaze ,
Forever Im young andll never get old
Smell the aroma , just follow your nose
We thug on the corner from night til the sun up
You run up get done up , Ill let it explode
Blow only where gangstas roll , so
Homie we smash around and we crash collide
Whoever dont wanna be foes , oh

Nigga come get it Ill stick like cactus ,
Money so tall those niggas need ladders
Try to come close but they never could match us
So catch us , we the masters
Yall already know how we do it on the Clair
Never compare we livin on stretchers

Nigga come through with Twist and Bust
Nigga been famous they know to aim it
They spittin my languange , " Adrenaline Rush "
Feminine niggas that been on rush
Back to the dust we winnin the clutch
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit !

Now be the coldest on the island , country or on the peninsula
Hit them with the venom and then Imma
Disintegrate em or fade em , fuck em cause hate em ,

Mayday one Kay Slay , drop the bomb on em when they put me on the track and Imma
Show em who was out when make em go and commit suicide dressed like Phantom or
Do and Im about to get dinner

Cause Im dope with the flow
Never know how flow was the dro
Imma eat bitch up and hope for some mo
So long is the poem , Im never ho
You can go check the portfolio
Kay Slay em just after fuck at you and then Imma stick em , you know we can go
Im cold so go get your coat
This be the season for niggas thats sneezin and snoozin
And if you keep testin me you gon be catchin beatin and bruisin whats up ?
Look at the mojo and look at the swag , and look at all the vernacular
Things be doin cause Imma stay infamous so they be callin me Dracula
Oops mean Blackula when Im attackin ya
Pullin up on em up in the new Acura
Or new pre-Camaro or new super Lego with the Pinot Grigio seats
see when you niggas be hatin , so the next time when you see me dont speak
Now you know not to send me no beat
Cause Imma kill it
And murder anybody Thatll wanna get it
Where they wanna get up in it cause be the realest
Im menace all the way up to the finish
Make an enemy diminish
When get up in the battle even if it gotta be on the block
2010 hip-hop , the shit dont stop

Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit !

What can it be ?
Rappers and thuggin on beats
None of em keepin it street
Look at them calves , all of them wanna be bulls
None of em ready for beef

Been through the pain
Sorted the lames , keep it the same
Skillful syllables kill
My rhymin technique is impeccable still
Anybody ever wanna run up
Will get done up in hurry
Got flurry
Imma hunt em for the come up
With bang you better run from the one until you permanently feel it

" The Originator , " gotta keep it greater
Keep the fader for the haters
Nigga real for real
The all-time thriller , ready rockin the death of it definite
On it cookin and cheffin it ( ooh ! )
Takin over the world
Made of with your girl
Motherfucker recognize the nigga Hugh Heffin it
Doin what you never did at double time , triple shot president
Aint nobody better in the residence
Through the crops , it aint stop
Over the top , bringin the soul makin it pop
Got old school banger make you do the wop
Got Louisville slugger make you diddy-bop
Ever incredible gotta keep it way ahead of you
Screamin at my niggas in the clink doin federal
No trip , no travesty
call the lick now Im up like anti-gravity
Spit words from the brain like charity
If hip-hop was broad shed marry me
Gotta keep it gutter , gotta get the bread , gotta get the butter
Make it hot , you can toast word to mother

Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit !
These streets made beast out of me
Six rings on my fingers
Put your fives and your ones up
Getting money , put your ones up
Now ball
Ball [ x12 ]

No worries , been killing it since she was shorty
rings like Michael Jordan , same team no Robert Horry
Put me on the verbal court with my competitors
Imma be fucking up all of them
Money like Steph Curry , and dish it out to my team like Chris Paul and them ( Griffin ! )
put in work , got rings
That winning feeling want cause if get the shot bet hit the shot
They have no choice to be killing em when spit it
Give me standing ovation when visit
Final four delivery , hall of fame flow
Right up in Nirvana is where my mother fucking hangs though
Nope !


Who the fuck is you talking to ? Nigga got six rings
When pull that whip up in front of the club be knowing they seeing it
And whoever dissing this , cause they are fisherman watching the finals and we in it
The league of the streets
Winning the game with three on the beat
Keeping that thang in the piano seat
One shot at your brain and they flee on their feet
They run up thinking be slipping
Long nose , 357 by my side , call me Scottie Pippen
And murder for the squad like an outlaw
Everything that say coming out raw
Plenty niggas know pulling up with Glock and key
Acting like they winning the game
Like they pulling up at the top of the key
But got them accolades , and spit that fast shit
You just an absurd sound , third round draft pick
And when win the game , then right there is your history
Celebrate like we do in Chiraq , we gon tear up the city

Killa , Psycho Drama , Twista , Chi-Town to Harlem whats really good ?

Part , What happens , when you combine the darkness , with the light ?

Yeah , am more than compelled and honored to expel
This hell thats inside of my shell for fuckers who want it
Violence , yeah that bullshit right up my alley , chasing you right up the alley
With gun fixin to kill you cuz feel you was the one fuckin with my family
roll wit gang of go-getters , and them ghouls and them gorillas
Who be quick to put the Glock or the gauge to the gut of one of your niggas and pull it
The trigga and deliver you niggas these rigorous bullets
Its so riveting to see you livin in vengance sit up and shrivel to pudding
Fuckin wit niggas you shouldnt , these menaces and villians and hoodlums
Thatll give you the business and in an instant be dimishin whoopin
Cuz it aint no type of jokin or jivin comin off of this
You done sommersaulted and dived in coffin of shit
So if you ever get the notion to just motion forward and get on some ho shit
You niggas remember that got that potion
To bore your brain in bag and give you new perspective on who the realest yall
You just cant kill one you stupid bitch , you got to kill us all

( Its your adrenaline rushhhhh )
Like when the motherfucka have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun , to make ya body get up and uhh
( Its your adrenaline rushhhhh )
Like when the motherfucka have to go and pick up the pump
To make the trigga pick up and dump
So turn the bass kick up the bump , and let the rhythm hit off the trunk

What can say to make you see how the fuck feel
To make me wanna run up in ya home
Shoot you in the dome , if you bustin my body up wit the chrome
stilla be in the zone like Capone
Better leave me alone , cuz represent the city known for killin motherfuckas
Makin plenty money and layin mack down
Cam buckin Twista spittin gritty competition what pity
You aint fuckin wit it then put ya stash down
Come at the family you touched uh , Ill shoot up ya V-12 even if you wit ya female uh
You was talkin shit nigga wassup , fuckin up ya Sprewells and ya new interior detail
And nigga standin too tall to fall , comin so hope yall can crawl
Bloody up the vest all the wall
Sacrifice my body screamin Kamakaze , can take all of yall


Yall niggas play around , guns wave around
Nigga better stay down , lay down , weigh pounds
Put em on the Greyhound , ride it up to K-Town ( Chi-Town )
The boy get nasty , Tell law enforcement blast me
Sawed-off and Im happy , or where the crack be
Put it right off of Pulaski
Cross street , dont need to be said
Code red already got beef with the feds
Put three in ya head , from the street full of lead
Fuck knee-deep youll be six feet when ya dead
Street sweeper when creep creep , nigga fled ( Flii-Flii )
When ya sleep sleep , nigga dead
Why you on the back block , fightin in the crack spot
Jackpot , ask not yes why not


Ya bitch is ho , she chill at the Rucker , you really sucka
Big Will tryin to grill her and cuff her
And Killa done fucked her , in love wit the chick , the slut was fish
Threw her bait , reeled her in and gutted the bitch
And now she , up in Pokips dick , huggin the strip slick
5th tucked in her hip , she will mug you for kicks
And word to mother Im rich , hit ya mother with bricks
Cocoa why dont ya build buildings with concussion the bitch

Come and feel wit the balla whos the nicest and causin the crisis
Got the ammo and agility that says rewind means growin before
And this livin and pause and this likeness
can spit it for some who for nigga represent the call of the righteous
Or gang bang to the rhythm when spit it
Imma kill em wit the technical precision thatll be fuckin up all the devices
Get sick wit it like Im lit off the wet , if its beef , get the shit off ya chest
Dont take off ya vest , all my niggas make you jump off the set
And always get the prints of the tech , straight off the deck
Mobbin up and makin niggas duck , knowin Ill still open up the trunk
Guns nigga we get em and bust
Murderin the enemy is the ultimate adrenaline rush

What happens when you combine the darkness with the light ?

Im bringing pain like two bad nurses , and the pain from these here
Motherfuckin verses ridiculous thirstses involving hearses
To the dirt shit first picks and usen autos to work with
Slugs to the shirt shit ( just to squirt shit )
wicked hit with an expert kick
And burst til the earth split leave you hurt bitch
Show you how worser than worst get in the zone
See the vein when the pain repel
And then they closin the curtains bitch
( when adrenalines pumpin )
dont understand discussion , only hear certain shit
Im misunderstood nigga and Im off my square high
Got me reversin clips and dispersin shit

What can say to make you see how the fuck feel
To make me wanna jump off of the edge
No pain , instead of caine took blunt off to the head
( so tell me what it said )
Retaliate with lethal repercussion

To go into thangs , like its wicked stick
Took the Benadryl , hot like Im fin ta steal

Then yo head bust when you jumped up
Cause what said mustve got you geeked , my eyes red puffed

And if you act bitch on the side , if we have to
Then the whole Westsidell let the shit go on and ride

Thats your adrenaline rush
Like when motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
Thats your adrenaline rush
Like when motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass , kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

Pullin up and bailin out like were carsick , Im ready to start shit
Start up buryin some heads like an ostrich
And unload the whole cartridge and throw the shells out the garbage
The hardest of motherfuckers could never achieve what Ive accomplished
Yungbucks my accomplice
Located his existance with my sixth sense like compass
And starting on journey established to stop this
Rushin up the hearts of the niggas to get em charged
Whats the real reason ?
All you haters try to murder me so now its kill season
And even though Im still bleedin
Im comin after you cause Im still breathin
And yall cant trace me
bury my victims in the wall like Gacy , too lyrical
And since its nipple my umbilical these flows is critical
This music is miracle like Im biblical
Killin like Im nuttier than buddy love
And still wouldnt leave bloody glove and start the truck up
And speed the fuck up getaway smokin this blunt
Dump the adrenaline eruptin my viens Im pumped up

And Im calibrated at 360 degrees
See thats 300 niggas that gon die about 60 slugs to do this deed

With this on the brink of fuckin up some shit
Dismantle deduct some shit
Its hard to imagine what niggas got nerves to do
( what niggas got nerves to do )
So guess Ill just take that fuckin nerve from you
Then think what Im on the verge to do
And got the urge to ooh let semi close yo curtains fool
From killin the verses fool be one of the worstest dude

Unleash these thangs then defeat yo purpose bitch you hurtin

All or nothin , fuck all the bluffin , wont let the po-po arrest me ;
Try to hit the deck to bless me
But Im still broke so ride like Frank & Jesse
But they cant catch me . Breakin niggas off like sawed-off
Comin for the fetty , man ; my millimeter bringin better things
When pull , like better bang , so if have to , Imma let it rang /
Gotta handle my functions , but an outcome , have somethin
Instead of nothin , haters hold me down
And servin thru stickup or somethin
Now gotta pick up the pump and let it ride
All or nuthin , step aside , or you can hit the paper big time ;
You gon murder like strychnine , wit grip nine , sever bitch time
Cuz gotta mine , and its on

You comin up short like million midgets masturbatin ;
Masqueradin as the most murderous madman militia
My nigga Twista told me
Monopolize , strategize , maximize , make money to win
With career sinners intake us , sinners
Turn ya whole placenta magenta , quintessential inventor
Please , we Cs and Bs , VLs and GDs ;
Got OGs , OZs , keys for these millionaire mo-neys
Release your shells , my nigga ;
Knew the job was dangerous , when took it , whys player
Dark tides , or say on how to walk crooked , look it
Got sophisticated ho mob
With assassin bitches that give my shotgun barrel blow jobs
So when the four stickin out like sore toe thong
Its no prob , vocally for sure squad , thorough man

Gotta get that cash , gotta get that dough
Stacks that you cant float
Kick in the door , we on the floor , come up off and hundred mo
Gotta get that cash , gotta get that dough
Shit , all or nothin , no bluffin , if have to , Im bustin

Nigga worthless to bones , like nickels to quarters
Fallers to shot callers , all of gotta get the paper somehow
For the school of the gun style , see me til the cops call us
Hell brought us , to situation where we gotta driveby
Let the bullets from my nine fly , to murder who you was deprived by
But admit sometimes if it wasnt for crime Id
Probably be broke and homeless while the start keep it low goin , homeless
So Im hookin up wit Ras Kass , on some shit we can stack cash
But if have to pull back rag fast , on that ass nigga

These savage streets full wit jackas , racists , crackers and cannibals
So its understandable , why Im half man , half animal
Ridin through the hood on my elephant like Hannibal
See , used to have dreams of fuckin an & bitch
And used to dreams of bein 21 and rich
One outta two aint bad , though , now Im tryin to be rich by age 25
See Shall survive that new world abchao
But you dont hear me


Homeboy , my games tight :
could talk the Virgin Mary out her panties the same night
From cocoon on the dark side of the moon
The illest nigga existin , know who you are :
FUBAR , fucked up beyond all recognition
In the middle of the ghetto Im buildin casino
Like Bugsy Siegel illegal employ niggas and Latinos
Shootout wit the ATF and FEMA , to free C-BO , see dough
They got me like Steven Biko , cept pack vente cinqo
Rowdy Los Angeleno , you got knocked the fuck out like Deebo

On scale of one to ten , what do you rate yourself
Heres some champagne , hydrate yourself
know Im lookin good , you lookin great yourself
mean you shittin on these bitches , you should hate yourself
My style so cold could skate myself
But go so hard could make it melt
mean the flow so solar every bar
Could power an electric car
My , my , my , whips is side-by side
He just talkin , mines outside
Do you mind if
Take you on test
Do you have all-wheel drive
And if that baby purr , Im gonna baby her
Bitches gon hate and maybe worse
Cause your ice so brrr copped you baby fur
Just to work
know you was on pur-pur
But this is whole new arena
See , niggas come by talkin bout they make it rain
Ill make that bitch Katrina
Mr . Kanye Omari , with my Entourage , no Ari
And motorcycle jacket , no Harley
She said dude , thats cool
Gnarly

Alright alright , alright
Alright alright , alright
Alright alright , alright
Alright , alright

Twista where you at
Abracadabra , did he vanish
Hurry up and come out
But aint want to panic
say that Im in the zone
But they dont understand it
Physically Im here but mentally Im on another planet
And it only kinda made em look at me like was stupider
Now they askin which planet , is it Jupiter
So let the money show cause know stacks could talk
Im mackin on bitches with my intergalactic thoughts
In my Mercedes Benz
Pull up on chick and holla at her and her lady friends
Like as rich as an Arabian
Im kickin pure flows
Euros they pay me in
For what put together in the dungeon
Im lookin for UK chick with nice onion
Never beat it up like Paul Bunyan
And cant believe they let an American Werewolf in London
Especially when drinking Gs with tonic
Steady be trippin while smokin on the hydroponic
When spit it like this they be callin me bionic
Kanye with the Twist , nigga , how ironic
And Im astonished haters dont wanna see me on
They wanna know how Twista get the easy dome
Swag off the chain , twenty-threes be chrome
Artful Dodgers with the Yeezys on
Gone


Im blowin on flame but yours is all white
And Imma pull up in the Bentley all white
Step up in the club with nothing but all dykes
Sippin on some Louis and partyin all night
Phony-ass people , dont feel they demeanor
So hop in the rocket and go and chill over Venus
One of raps heroes , who came from zero
Makin something out of nothing , call me Gilbert Arenas
Now Im fuckin with divas that rock the stadiums
Blow my brains back til my face be numb
am the shit
It dont make me numb
Rockin wit swagger like got an eight-feet gun
And my flow be colossal cause spit the impossible
Whether with rhythm no limit to what can do
See through prism when conquer an obstacle
And always get money no matter how illogical
follow through because , uh

[ Hook ] 10X
American gangsta , . hustla

Home of the brave and in God we trust

Chi-town bred

Annihilate them till dont see nothing left
Remember spit it for the bitches
Now Im spitting for the thugs
Hat cocked to the right
Hat cocked to the left
Brother its formal
Its focus on ya chest
spit it for the Lords , and for the Folks and for the Crips and for the Bloods
Im like an American Dream
Roll to the Green , with the Souls and the Breeds and the Cobras and Kings and the 2-16
Millimeter bullets from the niggas that
Trying to do opposite
They dont really wanna see how psycho can get
dont really see motherfucker stopping this
Trying to come at you and the apocalypse
. 40 cal will have ya screaming , dont wanna die
am becoming nauseous with the fake thugs
So its love
To the real Gs and all the bosses
To the niggas in the caller case
That got into it big
To get what nobody gave us
We was born into this system , so dont be mad at what you made us
Pull the pistol and cock it and bust in the sky
One time for the . , for turning my niggas to gangstas cause getting money is what they do best
Hard to fight like ever did like Al Capone
Gangstas is bosses
K-town is the motherfucking hood , the Rock is the company , come and step into my office

American gangsta , . hustla
Home of the brave and in God we trust
Im just American gangsta , . hustla
Home of the brave and in God we trust

Forever see me in lack
Got work but ya never see me in pack
motherfucker said he never seen me with strap
And heard motherfucker say he dont see me in the hood
Lil nigga dont see you , cause homie my hood is worldwide , and getting money is what we do
Make ya knee joints lock when freak you
Hit the point shot like Hedo
Turkoglu up in the game
You killing the game like Pac , nigga we point Glocks like he do , see you
No one will recognize Im the maker of the Midwest
Im like for real ?
Controversy in the middle . . .
guess Im like Shaquille
You can go on feel like ya feel
Nigga know the hands like to kill
But if you can hit me with the bangs
Lil cheap for shit , lets strike the deal
Got my psychos in the city rolling with me
Always ready bust cap at the king like duuu
can bury ya bodies like an animal
Because Im cannibal , eat nigga like food
Ripping through your flesh so can devour the heart
Music is my playground , but if the rapping dont get you , hit this head with the back of the pistol until this bitch nigga lay down
And no competition had to be fucking twig ?
Whoever coming for me gangsta , Im get it every time wanna get it . Im living proof
Its category F5

( Okay , okay )

Ayo . . ever since young buck , been on the come up
Known to dish the raw , dish the law if they come up
And cheddar till the sun up . .
If theres ransom and the law get involved , then we never get it summed up
Never put ya gun up , if ya come round me
go to war wit niggas round the corner from round me
You could front round me , but read through that
Wit the mili and aint talkin bout no Segal mac
Niggas see shoot back , we can see to that
Hit yo front letters see through back , bring yo peoples back
And used to grind out on my friends spot
til hes mom wanted my Tim-bots
Now my paint got me discounts
Or trans-quo all around the world , like was signed to Pimp-dot
And if its ten targets and got ten shots
Im tryin to leave at least nine out of them ten shot . .

got my mind on my money , money on mind
But some say its gift , dont write but rhyme
, complete songs with just one try
Tell em its no lie , beef all my life . . . dogg
never think , its already there
find ways to say it , so you motherfuckers hear it
And when you hear it you feel it , you know its real so
This is how live it , how its pictured for real . . . nigga
Im shittin for real
Diamonds against wood , underground king for real
Big crib when lay , yeah Im livin for real
Trust me the guns come off the shelf whenever shitll get real
Automatics and extended clips , thats what Im hittin wit
Dummies in the black rhinoes
Yeah , they be killin shit
Masked up kidnap shit , thats how my niggas get
Chi-town , NYC , thats how my niggas get . .

Yes , just picture me rollin
The smith and wessonll stay goin put hole in yo chest
Its just , another hustle paper gettin made and fold
Get mad , you street niggas finally made it
swoop five , he know the ride , heavily loaded
Deliver pies like cake , they go straight through yo payment . . . yup !
Chump . . . you dont really wanna war
With the State Prop clique , if ya clique shot us , squad up
S-P game so damn tough , the in the 5th tucked yall cant hang
Transporter turned rapper , get camcorder film my life
Still acclompished , tryin to fill they cups
The rap version of Mandela , call my bluff
We still the street dwellers , feel my pain ( my pain )
spit verse and split clip in the rain
fool-proof when the full force open you up ( what ! )

Twista will rock you , you dont want the thug apostle to pop you
Hostile when drop you , turnin everything colossal to fossiles
speak street gospel , all they life spit words and paint portraits
For real niggas that hold down they fortress and serve off of porches
Hit em in the body wit the powerful forces , thatll end all your doubt
Make you clean up your house , bag up an ounce , hit the dance floor and bounce
We blessed wit the talent , fuck wit this clique , it aint gon be easy
Cause you fuckin wit Twist if you fuck wit Chris , Bleek and Free-wheezy
So speak and breath easy . . . Or the scutches my future in 3D
like wars , Im from city full of Vice Lords , and GDs
Breeds and Souls , 2-6s , Kings , BDs and Stones
Spanish cobras and all the true soldiers , survive and Im gone !
Watch me spit if for the killers and hustlers , flippin all the pounds and bricks
Hate on me Imma bust at you hoes , and put eleven down wit clip
Niggas servin fiftys and hundreds , when see you and Im on yo tip
Twista and this East-Coast regime , its that chi-roc shit
Im about to take everybody back to the basics
Im historical an oracle event is about to occur
Because motherfucker put these raps in the matrix
And Im terror when spit it on tracks full of hatred
But theres beauty in the dark , just put it in yo mouth
And the flows like mmmmm , like that when you taste it
Commin at niggas like disciple of death , you would think
Im poppin rifle or tech , Im aimin right for the neck
Yo momma might as well call up the funeral home so she can
Right em check , vile of dialect . Thats why they feelin me
trilogy , horror is what become so they call me jason vorhee
Oops mean chasin more cheese , niggas gotta pay some more fees
Hot enough to brake thermometer from another planet kill em
From here to Andromeda , astronomer because Im out of the galaxy
Challenge me will disintegrate yo body like particle
Follow you into corridor at in the mornin so can horrify you
Rite before slaughter you . My boys sayin they dont think Im comin
So you know nigga gotta get em all . Then Ima be murderin em
Like serial killer then Ima hide em in the sealing and the wall
Fuck em all . Niggas will never get next to this
rock rollie so flex the wrist . Ima blow up and sit in yo place
Then through up shit in yo place like the exorcist
You cant mess with this

Now lets take shit back to the basics
How we used to do shit
With the original sound but still somehow comin with that new shit

Talk about the way there aint no morals or respect in the streets no more
Dont pause with the heat no more
Cause there really aint nothin out here to eat no more

Now days niggas actin like they lovin the dime , used to be some respect
But now they just kill em and stack em cuz Benjamin Franklin the governer now
Theoretically you better be ahead of everybody around you cuz nigga might fuck you
Dontt need to be nothin but killers in yo family that always surround you cuz nigga
Might touch you . Since the recession Its been hard on the streets
So nigga comin hard on the beats . No order in the hood
remember when niggas would get into it , they would have to take problems to chief
Now they dont give fuck who they be shootin or who they be robbin or what you ride
All they really care about is you got that , and if you let one of these knuckle headed bitches
Know you sittin on somethin , motherfuckers guna be at that

Its those south side murderers
Its them west side killas

Up north and over east is beast , what they release be leavin you desceased
Fuck up anybody that try to do damage , the block is the planet and shorty is too buck
For there to be peace , so carry piece , but dont wana shoot cuz already wana
See some of my niggas locked up in jail home , instead of hollerin at em on cell phone
. . cuz my lil brother Rel gone . We need to find another way to get it instead of always
Being on the attack full of hatred , or get smacked in the face with the reality of death
If we dont get back to the basics

( Twista Verse )
Bastards and Bitches , after my riches
Im so spectacular with this now lets get back to the business . .
Im like Dracula with this , my vernaculars endless
Ask if its fact or fictitious , but its just the act of menace . .
Nigga this far from scary and Im like barbarian
Arian , air he inhalin until start to airin em
So dont even start comparin em , or Imma just start to bury em
Im darin em , to come take swim in the sharks aquarium
Lyric extortionist , turn you to carcasses , every portion is
Thoughts of awkward vocal contortionist . .
On my mom and them Im better than them who copy my flow like homonym . .
And Amoxicillin will not stop the villain , its pain inflict when Im bombin em
God like Im Andromedan , better yet Osiris or should just say Asaar
Father of Heru , told you that was astonishing
Take walk in my moccasin , can send you through journey of knowledge and horror
Sodom and Gomorrah , biblical verses as if was reading the Torah

( Shawnna Verse )
Bastards and Bitches , after my riches
But count my stacks and my digits like was 10 mathematicians . .
You gonna slice your wristiphon . . . tights be glistenin , do what can maestro the brightest like nitro glycerin
My oral skill is horrible chlorophyll
Hallucinogenic that you get so dumb like Canibus or pill
Shawnna can do shit that be damaging
Leaving them standing stiff as Manikin
Burn bitch up cause Im hot
Aint nothin that can be cured with no medicine
But the way that spit is magic cause Iam sorcerous conjuring fortresses leaving the floor full of carcasses
Motherfuckers should bow to this
On the core with this , am beast hottie bangin bodies with niggas
My hobby is triggas , so dont make me have to come and go shotty your nigga

Travellin dimensions from another planet
But spit that fly shit , though
That shit go , damn , that shit blow

Verse :
Fendi , Prada , Enny

Yelling out like Louie , yelling out moo-boo
Yelling out like Wayne , yelling out soo-woo

Verse :
In the beginning there was " Adam " , A-T O-M

kick logic , science
Astrological when be spitting you verse
Feel like you probly fucking with me , you the first
But in parallel universe !
All up in my face
Oh , you think you something ?
Atoms an almost empty space
The cells in your body got their own DNA
With my adrenaline and venom can turn em into
Minimal amount of matter when in murder mode
Screwface , am the Omnipotent of verbal evolution
Like genes , chromosomes , theories of existence
Aint no tellin where take ya
Bio photons turning on codons
Activating divine nature !

Travellin dimensions from another planet
But spit that fly shit , though
That shit go , damn , that shit blow
Travellin dimensions from another planet
But spit that fly shit , though
That shit go , damn , that shit blow

Niggas coming at me
Niggas coming at me
Me and my closest roll dog
Came up in an early age on the corner servin cane
Gang bangin and everythang
We some mutherfuckin gangstas
Broke to the right
Blood in Blood out brothers and we swore that was for life
Servin them keys and be clocking them gs and
We got whatever you need just come and see me
Or my mutherfucking nug bout to show this city up show love
Or catch that bug from that nine millimeter slug
broke bread with this nigga , bust lead with this nigga
Heard he fucking with the feds
Cant believe it , not my nigga
Selling me for the cash , was he moving too fast
Talking behing my back to them damn hood rats
Im going crazy aint that bitch
You try and get bitched and your closest rodey
Turns into snitch
Just smiling and laughing in your fucking face
Went behind your fucking back hooking you with fucking case
Going insane and dont know what to think
Paranoid out my mind as take another drink
Of that hennessy motherfuckin cognac
Got me reaching for my nine
Bout to peel this niggas cap
So waked out the house
And headed for the corner
seen that nigga creeped up on him
Bitch yous goner
Up that itchy to his temple whyd you try to fuck me Rodey
Starting crying seeing me
Nigga , this aint to New Jack City
And my name aint no mutherfuckin Nino Brown
tear roll down my cheek and blew his brains on the ground
Sirens all around lights all in my face
Dick boys on the case so headed towards the gate
Bitch freeze
Bitch please
Thats what told them punk ass cops
All of sudden heard the shot
Couldnt believe just got popped
Didnt drop , turned around , grapped my nine , then pulled it
Everything turned cold and got dark
couldnt feel nathan but the beating of my heart

Blood in blood out
thought that we was family
Cant believe he crossed me
Got to break him off
Am my brothers keeper
thought that was for life
Its gonna be murder this nigga gots ta die
( Twista )
Check out my straps
Im finna flex holdin them
Picture how bust at these niggas like Cineplex Odeon
Im finna step over them , come see how Im bussin
Catchin slugs in your heart and lungs is deadly repercussion
got big guns and my bullets is the achiest even though you hate me its hard to believe like atheist
Never to offend any Christian if youre listenin but be Christ-like in bright white garbs , my life is interestin
points of man than under the body decrescent
Intelligent intellect like the internet Im omnipresent
Then when the spirit leaves the flesh that God be testin
Wrapped in linen cloth in the pyramids where be restin
Syllables catastrophic to the mind state of sucker
Complex to scientific heathen , complicate your mental structure
Circuitry through my lyricism , spit cyber-Gothic
Hot wires in the cockpit , everything made with fiber optic
Fire in the rocket , takin me up to the stars
Galactic bars got me sportin fly cars on Mars
Intricate patterns enablin me to get money when be on Saturn
Aint nobody up in the galaxy willin to challenge me when be rappin
Twista so cold , flow so ridiculous hes so meticiulous
They got the vapors and none of it he had to write on the paper where he was just spittin and kickin it
bars at time , youre thinkin its somethin you like now
Imagine if it was some shit that chose to write down
Superstar , man Im far from an average Joe , supernatural
Stepping out , looking like Im in fashion show
Came into this industry and now youre witnessing me blow up
Like seeing tank of gas explode
And Im , Im high like Im flyin sitting back of coach
By the window sipping Jack and Cokes
Bout to pack bowl but we aint tryna bake casserole
Looking at the globe from up high , shots fired
Like Kennedy was riding by the Grassy Knoll
aint rich but got little cash to blow
When haters saying that Im changing
Ill be looking at them laughing like they cracked joke
They wasnt with me when traveled down this gravel road
GC , could never have my pass revoked
So step up and you dead duck
Get your head bust , looking like chef just cracked yolk
Speakers in the Caddy rattling the patio
When the industry was only rocking platinum gold
was dope back then , but you had the whole
Shit locked until came and cracked the code
And dont , dont really mean to brag and boast
But then again , my fans look at me as the . . .
She said she listen to my music in the bath and soak
Now thats rap to quote , hop in my Lac and float
Ya Uh Yeah

Take puff and its up and away we go
Put some pimp shit on my radio and bounce , bounce , out
Let the bass vibrate my chest , take it to the Midwest
Brought it back to the south , and bounce , out

With my homie Tony footwork
Up in Kalamazoo , balling out up in the mall
We dont bounce til we spend couple thousand on shoes
Im repping clintel , how can lose , you out of the loop
These music dudes were clueless who was
Til blew , producing woohs and oohs and ahs
Im the truth , what you confused ? Are you surprised ?
refuse to lose , been booed and crucified
Disapprove the movement , crews get brutalized
If these pooches choose to bite , get euthanized
Im the new , the who is who gets neutralized
Twenty twos are huge , my shoes are supersized
Out on cruse , my music boomin stupid loud
Bumping Ball & MJG , from the outside looking in
Im sitting on top of the world , but then again kind of been lately
When pull up in my Cadillac , my speakers got that rattle back
Im flashin back to when was attacked by
couple pretty bitches that was begging me to pick em up
And take em in and fuck em from the back side
But aint got no time to fuck around , Im trying to buckle down
And focus on my money , so stack my
Paper to the ceiling , Im feeling like billion
Im filling up my cup with that crown and bounce out


Diamonds on my body , so appealin jottin down my feelins
Acting like it was the realest shit ever wrote
Mental telepathy is part of the recipe
That let me know that you want it
Im giving it to you how you like it
Biology of pimp , it be in the DNA
To know what you thinking
can make your life so appealing by the way write it
Make it so she the only shawty know
roll up one and light it
On the passenger side of ride
Like player , Imma be up in the club talking the big shit
Strange Music , we be the misfits
Come and twist Rittz , tisk tisk , cause you gon get your shit split
Middle of the map and nigga finna snap
And let em know the area continue to kill em forever , we on
Better be strong to live in the city come from
And we can either talk about it or be about it
When hear something like this up on the radio
All nigga can do is just bounce

Got million things on my mind , executive deals online
Limited amount of time , chasin these dollar signs and you aint on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the
Fuckin off fetti coulda put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten , my niggas put murder missions
She choosin , thats her decision , free my niggas in prison
On the phone with bitch who cant do shit
For pimp but make nigga hella rich
Got blunt in my dental , goin HAM in rental
On my way , to Sacramento , late night , Arsenio
Im never sentimental , go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley , Im chromeless , you might end up domeless
bet you she into me , her cheddar , she givin me
Ill make bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp , Pimp , underground king of the South
raise my Styrofoam up , and pour some drank in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news ?
Say you want me to win , but hope lose
Askin if rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool , its just that


got new chick that gotta thank God for
got new whip that gotta thank the lot for
Yeah got lot but want lot more
Yeah we in the buildin but Im tryna take it to the top floor
swear hear some new bullshit every day Im wakin up
It seems like nowadays everybody breakin up
That shit can break you down if you lose good girl
guess you need bad bitch to come around and make it up
guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got bad side , even conscience
Now youre drinkin til your unconscious
Feel me when you get fine bitch
Just dont forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin like Im in the Himalayas
Keep it with the lit on me like the elevator

Hey . Where the camera at ?
Im trying to hammer that your glamor got rappers , actors , et cetera having damn attack
And its that bam and back thats standing fat with your rack
Lets get candid act like your Janet Jack and mash in the sack
Or pretend your Nikki Nova while film and flip it over
Get me closer to sticky soaking women if the poker
This is the culture Where we kiss the concha
And if she know to get below the big derover lick these soldiers strictly vulgar

( Look at her go ) Watching you on the .

Pussy juice dripping just like PET milk
We on that Lammie & shrekkin beary

Just like water balloon ( Water balloon )
She took the rubber off and ate my sperm with spoon
If that aint pornographic

Booty checks , tatted , pierced pussy lips
Silicon plastic oral injections
Is just big hips on my erection
dont spend money on hoes
Hoes spend money on me

By using my mouthpiece

You heard what E-40 said

Dick boss macking
Hustling is my habit

Biatch !


Debbie does Dallas , Doggy does Debbie
Baby are you ready ? This shit is getting heavy
Dipping like Chevy , hold it real steady

Yeah , blue jeans , Air ones and white tee
06 hangin out the window like , yee
Hyphy on one , off bottle might be , my tree
Smokin Agent Orange , Hi-C
Back when me and Marty was recordin at my Moms
Most of yall were chasin around bops
was in the lab , only hoping that my job
Never would be based around mops now Im on
Yeah , she know ; love me cause my ego
Girls and the drugs always follow us where we go
Ay , where the Bay at ?
Shouts out to Jay Ant
Lookin for the party girls , let me know where they at
Skinny rich girls always askin where the yay at
Throw house party like cool , where you stay at ?
Turn upside down , let her twerk on the wall
Took her to the bathroom and did work in the stall

They used to tell me couldnt go too far alone
They used to always say couldnt go too far alone
But now Im here bitch ! ( x3 )

( G-Eazy , let E-Feezy tell his story ! )
It aint funny what Ive been through
Your enemy can be some kin to you
started off hella broke
Hung around people thats older than me , took notes
Momma worked three jobs on the weekends
Used to help her wash the walls at Mare island
In Vallejo naval houses
Havin roof over my head was my allowance
The oldest of four , young adults
Surrounded by grief , big dreams and hope
They hated and they doubted
How did you take it ? Took it with grain of salt
wanted it badly , they couldnt stop me , Indie
Erry label wanted to sign me
Grew up on Short and Freddie
( Who else ? ) Magic Mike and Calvin


From the BART train to tour bus
Still the same game except Im pulling more sluts
More butts , more bucks , never giving more fucks
Did it my way , Im never taking short cuts
Raised in that town like fool , who put you upon ?
Huh , E-40 , Mac Dre is who grew up on
Im just selling game got you if you need coupon
You can check my resume , see every beat threw up on
Smoking on grapes , rollin up swishers , no papes
Back of the Ghost , closed drapes
Im boss tycoon
Girls in the crowd all swoon
Super high , Im off to the moon
And vanished with your girl then took her to my room
She wants me to slay ooh-kay , that means doom
Boom , and its to be expected
Knew this would happen as soon as she texted

All the little bad bitches in here
If you came to get ratchet , say " yeah "
Baby , touch your toes
We can get freaky , have an episode
Tell me is ya with that
Episode , tell me is ya with that

dont like it , love it , wanna grip it and touch it
Im tryna hit it and fuck it , stab it and stick it and stuck it
Get you to lick it and suck it and kiss it after nutted
We can be friends , aint gotta be seen in the public
Im about that verb , that action , have that coochie having contractions
When be smashing and smacking and sapping , thrusting and thrashing
Sit back and relax and have glass of this bottle
Earl Stevens selections : mango moscato
Beautiful girl , you so bad , look like somebody done drew ya
My eyes salute ya , you sight for sore eyes , booty and thighs
You and yo girls should get with me and my guys
Come and get bar of this mackin , baby girl , get rid of that sap
He aint real , he fraud , baby girl , that dude is cat
When he first intervened , he bought you flowers , no doubt
But once he got in good , he started doggin you out


Shawty in love with them gangstas , thats why she holla at me
country nigga be whipping up 15 thousand key
You just be giving her , getting her , just fill her with

She got extensions of booty with them tattoos on her cheek
Make me wanna take her to island , we could do it for weeks
Girl , let me Birkin your bag , Jimmy Choo on your feet
Let me get you out of the Jag and in that Bentley GT

From the streets to the suites anywhere we can meet
Del Amo to Compton , Slauson Swap Meet
Worldwide get swept away by the tide
By Gs and BGs , OGs its time to ride

Who the rider , looter through the gutter man
Trued up in them Carolina blue Hurricanes
From the Westside striving to dead em
Where them killers throw that third letter up
Like Raymond Washington and Tookie Williams
Blue jeans , blue strings , blowing blueberry green
Cadillac on blue Ds and blue tee
Money thick as blue cheese chunking up the dub
What the West be without Snoop and Dub and one Blood

The Bay Area fuckers we pop em
Open you up if you got problem
Up top born in Cali-forn ia
Clean your clock open your can of tuna
Make choice either its hell or its heaven
Get your chest layed out with the FM 57
This aint nothing to do with nobody
But in the Yay there aint nothing to do but catch bodies

Im coming straight outta PAT like Compton in all black
But when we say what it do they never say holla back
Bun the OG like 95 Air Max
Neon green outta Flight Club offa Fairfax
Ask The Hundreds , its doable done done it
At the summit of rap and Im watching you haters plummet
Run to it or run from it to Bun it dont differ
Wipe the streets with you like you swiffer as gifter one blood

Im the realest youngster thats breathing and dont gotta give reason
Chamillionaire millionaire , yall competing to be competing
My purpose is to get the cheese and as purpose that should defeating
So shut your mouth , have seat and be quiet till finish eating
My label tells me Im greedy , hogging all the room on your tv
Like Eric they think its Eazy , but it isnt easy believe me
Need to make room in . . television if you wanna be me
Game said he made room for Jeezy , had to make room for me ,

Its one Blood if you Blood or Cuz
From that number one Thug its still one love
rep my blue boy team but do it for green
do it for my folks Vice Lords and Kings
All the trappers future rappers standing out on the blocks
Tryna get up out the hood man and stack em knot
Put your sets in the air scream fuck the cops
We gon rep for the hood man like it or not

My feed mashable , murders are catastrophical
Cars is improbable Im overcoming obstacles
Trapping made it logical my topic is impossible
got partner named Shoe Strang cause shorty real crossable
Shark meat to Pappadeaux , cars be tropical
All guns choppable all blocks are mobbable
Im unstoppable my calico is toxable
Lyrically diabolical , cushion is not ? ? ?

Red rum , red rum such power in the tongue
Never in the wildest was he talking to them
Style on niggas but feel it to the numb
Japanese thread brought flavor to these bums
Consider me the savior , look what the Lord gave you
My celebrated presence like the return of Rayful
Frolic in the snow so playful
And reviving the track like we flowing through jumper cables
What duo you know get XXL kudos while copping off Coolio
Classic shit we mastered this left for dead , Im back
Im Lazarus

Nigga , one Crip , one Blood
LA , New York
The Game , the Rule , one love guns up
Hands down , cant touch the flow is bit much
The style wanna keep up
Id advise you to speed up
With money moving like coke these days gotta re-up
up , cop some heaters and dare nigga to act up
You see us in dual seaters and throw it up
Its all hood niggas rep your sets if your Cuz or Blood
Niggas , we all bleed
These niggas cant breathe
Only because the guns are drawn and aimed to part
Niggas that got bullets with names on them
Want em , come get em niggas yall know where to get at me
Look at me now pass me maybe you can be half me
You bastards , Im laughing bullets sticking in family
Who sadly gets torn between one Crip and one Blood
Yall niggas know me , yeah
Just about anybody who used cocaine in the 90s and 80s was using Pablo Escobars product

You probably want to mind your business
Act like you cant see or hear
A-tisket , a-tasket
Now the fuck nigga in the casket
My money stretch like elastic
Serving that tragic magic
That nasal candy , that nostril dust
You dont really want to go to war with us
Ashes to ashes , dust to dust
Bringing in work in U-Haul trucks
Got more bags than Kris Kringle ( Santa )
Puffing on spliff of Bullwinkle ( spinach )
Manipulate broad with the lingo ( slang )
She let me hit it we aint even have to mingle ( game )
All up in her panties like single
Put it down like Im Mandingo ( beat em )
Having my chips like Reno ( feddy )
Guns longer than the neck on flamingo ( thumpers )
If youre ready already , then you aint gotta get ready
Im out here selling that Becky , bout my chalupa , my fetti
Hoping the law dont catch me grittin out here pushing that white
Serving fiends , smoking out of homemade pipes
Im thug from the mud , Ive got the block in my blood
Ill take the top off the bottle and drink up all of the suds
Down and dirty bout mine , Ill put some cheese on your thoughts
Some bread on your head , no matter the cost , my . . .

Tax bitch like Uncle Sam
Fuck niggas be like " aw man "
Cause we young niggas and we getting it

Yall niggas blue cheese
Only talk big money , with real niggas
Yall niggas too cheap

Enjoyed myself when was out there tryin ta get in that mail
We used to kick it at the waterfront the whole Vallejo
Watchin the pervin contestses between E-40 and Del
Thats what we did up under the bridge fools posted up
Choppin game conversatin gettin toast up
Leanin against my seamless convertible tops and boosted cleaners
Them Click boys mobbin deep in cuts , actin meanest

Guess in order to do some right had to do some wrong
Picked up package yesterday and was HAPPY
It was box and full of goodies from my PAPPY
Tripped me out aint seen or heard from Poppa Duke in years
Sent me picture and some fetti dang they sheadin tears

Ready for combat if you plottin and plannin
Oh if you come for me and confiscate my dough

[ E-40 ] Man , you motherfuckers dont know nuttin about no timin

[ 2Pac ] Thats right , thats right boy start that shit off

heard rumour died , murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction , some coward got the story twisted
Like no longer existed , mysteriously missin
Although Im worldwide , baby aint hard to find
Why spend most of my time , my California grind
Watching for thievin Im cautious its like Im barely breathin
Puttin bullet in motherfuckers give me reason
See me and hope Im intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
Im addicted to currency in this life lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin , too scared to fight
For the life of me , cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin life after night of fuckin around with me
And if you dont like this rhyme
Then bring your big bad ass to California , cause we aint hard to find


got my locs on hard hat goin to war
Breakin them off on sight , stoppin lives like red lights
Watch em pause as pull my strap , out my drawers
And get to dumpin on they ass , like the last outlaws
Rich , 2Pac and the Click , smokin blunts , loadin clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we aint hard to find is the tales that we kick

Im fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
Im ridin shot gun with the tint in the back
Im plan to have motherfuckerin mint in this rap
Im from the V-A L-L E-J
Where sellin narcotics is all know
got blow , speed , bleed , whatever yo kind
And if you need motherfucker aint hard to find

Some may call me Bootsy , but call it timin
Thats while keeps on grindin ( thats right )
To the point where nigga cant stop
Too much feelin this shit , thats why Im quick to peel bitch
Whether its nigga or ho , ho
Get in my way , then that ass gots to go
Cause nigga steady plottin
serves hit for hit , and motherfuckers keep droppin


[ 2Pac ] C-Bo and D-Shot , E-40 , Richie Rich
[ E-40 ] Da Bay , beitch !

Down the steps
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy cant be scary
Playboy , what the fuck is the proof without the drama play
Nigga , what the fuck you got gun for , if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake all those I-was finst-to ask niggas
Motherfuckers-didnt think-I was-gon do-somethin ass niggas
Threaten your life , aint like you love him
Bury your thoughts , take his head fuck him have at him

Check this out
grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga
hear he tryin to ride
Double-edgin for the other side
But now , my Glock be so judgemental
Back seat of rental
Keep my name out your dental , nigga
If your gum bleeding and you needing
More than twenty stitches , you behaved like them bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game
Check the resident , its all the same
Nigga , and we aint hard to find

[ 2Pac ] Hell nah we aint hard to find
[ C-Bo ] The whole clickilation fool
[ E-4 ] ) Motherfuckers hard to find , right here bitch

[ C-Bo ] Nigga be lookin all the way when he see you and shit
Its celebration , Young Pac is back
[ E-40 ] Motherfuckers better understand this shit
[ 2Pac ] Ay D-Shot nigga can we get paid man ?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up ?
Hey , we smokin , and we aint hard to find
Drinkin and shit , fuckin with some hurricane

Sideways to the next light . . .

Call me whip it back and forth
Mister get it off the porch
Ima hit em with the torch
Getting money is sport
Talk and dance ery day
Mama taking me back and forth to court

Uh
It aint gotta be over no skrilla
Man dummyll kill ya
Eat you up with the rototiller
Nobody can heal ya
Welcome to the mind of the fried and burnt
Cali-harm ya life souped up and turnt
No ski mask , bare faced and all
Been looking forward for years , finally seen him in sol
chance he probly never would have got if it was night
There at an intersection , two active cameras at the stoplight
Disobedient and hardheaded
As you can see and can tell
School and education he failed
But in the streets he prevailed
His grandma used to always yell :
" Slow down sonny or you gonna end up going to hell
And you gonna burn for eternity . "
" Forever ? "
" Yeah , eternity . "
" Man G-O dont give mother-fuck about me ! "
The mind-frame of youngster
Depended on who he up under
Not acquired at his funeral singing " Going Up Yonder "


Cant nobody melt me
Fucker never felt me
Til somebody shove me Im the sickest nigga healthy
Theres nothing you can tell me
Dice dont sell me
These hoes want to nail me
You niggas dont smell me
Cant stay up out of jail and he
Back and forth to court
Seen him in downtown Vallejo
He be : " Cousin you got port ? "
said : " Brodie dont smoke . "
He said : " Its cool , "
Showed me 40-cal torch
" Lil nigga you fool . "
Getting money be the sport
So we ball like Laveranues
Grown men clips yet
And bitches looking thirty-ish
Everybody clean but we do suckers the dirtiest
Nice with the flow everything spit is courteous
But still move mean like road rage
Give nigga that gas , he need Rolaids
Magazine , homie , you could get whole page
Stay up in bad bitchs mouth like cocaine


Make dope fiend my spokesman

Get him going , hell be back and then he spendin chips ( Chill ! )
Sucker repellent , stay far from me ( Watch out nigga ! )

If they fire itll wake niggas game up

Aint no money why the lawyer gon show up ?

Prepared for the hatred
With my problem solver my patriot
Goon up and get tooned up
Dropped off erased it
Stay dedicated and faithful to my camp ( what about yo camp ? )
Try ? ? ? my loved ones they get stamped
Stapled , removed
Soil tested and block approved
Really good dude
But he can get trooped
From the school of hubbarocks some life savers up in the socks
Sprintin and runnin from the cops
The cherries , the sirens
The po-po penelope one time
The sophisticated dog trained attackers
The K9 Sheppards
In order to do some right you gotta do some wrong
Got hella shit goin on
The dusty , the dirty , the smirk ( ugh )
aint nervous
When you cookin birdies in the kitchen
Cant be slippin like transmission
Gotta be on your peesin toes

When your kids aint got no clothes

Playin the game how it was meant to be played

Money hungry and sany
Soil savy and grainy
Hard headed and mannish

Bam bam bamboo ( X8 )

Ughhh , the beat is excruciating
Youre liable to find me up in an old school on Zeniths or Daytons
Scooting and skating , beating and quaking , waking up the ave
With yellow bone the same complexion as cab
Money on my agenda ever since came out the placenta
Blowing and puffing on this indica
Put you in your place
Send couple of crash dummy , open up your face
In the meantime in between time , speakin money into existence
Speakin money into existence , talking it up


Ugghh
First off , we the opposite of soft
We love to get twisted like fingers crossed
We stay smoking like bad exhaust
Raculini ? , Zucchini , aviation , vegetation
Protection my weapon of choice , magical
Walther ppq m2 , tactical
like guns with bolt action , like mossberg
Everybody in my platoon in tycoon for sure
Trips to Jamaica , vacation buy up the top floor
got ears , be spitting minute ? bitch . Wordsmith got cold sales pitch
can sell paper to tree , water to the sea , snow to Tahoe , chips to Bellagio


All up in their ear like , bamboo
Bamboo ( bamboo ) Bamboo ( bamboo )

Bamboo ( bamboo ) Bamboo ( bamboo )

On mission about my mail , petulant , chicken , Burneys and 12s
Rob nigga if have to , if all else fails

It might not come back on me now but this will come back on me later
Im from it , built for battle the Bay maybe in peace
Same Levis for weeks 501s , no crease
pack cannon , 44 like Clint Eastwood you see
cannon ? Yeah but not the cannon camera 7D
Im whiskey , office landy
dont know when Ill be sober again
Im just not falling down from the sky finally coming down off my high
If it wasnt for the water the rap game will be dry
So feed the soil life resuscitate the game
Breath life back in every real nigga that we lost mane

Uh , he an animal , beast
He dont eat , nigga he feast
" Youre barbarian , savage "
Same jeans , for weeks
Out here with the zombies , fiends and tweeks
" Youre barbarian , savage "

Do the development while might better tetch it dont wanna get caught loose
Some of these niggas are Ill when they get on pills and courage juice
Alot of these dudes aint real lot of us cats are synthetic

Now dont need no liabilities , cant be taking the risk
Gotta say found , go hard like them Marion Barbarians
What is beef ? Can be no vegan or vegetarian
In the streets , kinda hardly to let the palm trees mislead
Can hear what that tough guy had activity will bleed you
Every time look around hear the streets blocked up
Its just like where you say send ya back in the pine house
take my shirt off in this bitch , stretch marks and all
Turn into something , put my back against the wall
Dig the chalking Im punching Im tryna break nigga jaw
Keep swinging and swinging until my enemy fall
BEOTCH !


Mommy and daddy never home so we raised ourselves
No dental plan , medical insurance and health
So Im out here with these zombies , dope fiends and tweeks
Bodies in the streets , covered with sheets
Unlicensed drunk drivers , sex offenders apprise
Suppose to be sain folks sinners and backslides
It aint for play , one thing about Los Angeles , San Diego and The Bay
We quick to throw it all away in one day
Over some he say she say
Lock me up and throw the key away give me . . .
Give fuck Im diet hero came my mentality
Be barbarian till Im old and grey for eternity
Ghetto celebrity , hey , specializing selling

Zips , zaps , zubbles , peas for three
Thow-wow pound , nigga holla at me , beotch
Eeuungghh

Im sitting on cloud nine times out of ten
You can find me with cup in my hand
Filled to the rim with oil
Throwing up the middle finger
But Im not an alcoholic Im just serious social drinker
Heavy thinking , thumper toting , never trust nobody but
Cause the scandalous be plotting , and if they could they would try
Like last night at the club
God as my witness
was sitting at my table
Minding my own business
Living it up to the highest
Like every day is Christmas
sucker tried to try us
Hating on our riches
guess they didnt like us
Cause we got all the bitches
But they didnt want to fight us
Cause my niggas we the shiznit
Fuck compromising , explaining , and trying to reason
Well catch em outside of the club and leave them niggas leakin
be beastin

One lonely beasty be !
( Beast dont suck up to none , dont be no sucka )

When my money was hecka small
made it look like it was tall
Punch hater up in his jaw
If he didnt want to shake my paw
When used to push that raw
On the other side of the law
Where the prices fluctuate and go up and down like see-saw
Nah this aint no hee-hah
Clown shit , this real
slap busta with the heel of my hammer up out my skrill
take uptempo track
Put some game behind my rap
Im like that
Motherfucker Im mack
Hide yo back
Before you fuck around and get snatched

The hillside to be exact
Cattin off and sipping aint what this playa do son
Theres only like seven real niggas left on this earth

The rawest nigga speaking

Bosses do what they want
Suckas do what they can
Aauuaauuaaggghh

Gotta pocket full of money and Im confident
Gotta get the landy cognac and some romulan
Some romulan ?

Its handling but my strand of choice , is sativa
When she was young she wasnt looking all that tight take Meagan Good for example
Now she looking right

Good God Almighty . Like back in the old days . You know , years ago they had the & men to tell you what to play , how to play it and you know whether its disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it . We had the champagne in the studio , of course , compliments of the company , and we just laid back and did it . So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you . Because we had ball . Only real music is gonna last , all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow . . .

Cash rules everything around me

After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto , just talkin women and vino
The contract like 91 Dan Marino

Overly focused , its far from the time to rest now
Debates growin bout who they think is the best now ?
Took while , got the jokers out of the deck now
Im holdin all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
hear you talking , say it twice so know you meant it
Fuck it , dont even tint it , they should know whos in it
Im authentic , real name , no gimmicks
No game , no scrimmage , aint playin with you niggas at all
My classmates , they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents , but thinkin back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn , bridges burn , you live and learn
With the ink could murder , word to my nigga Irv
Yeah , swear shit just started clickin dog
You know its real when you are who you think you are


had Benzes fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but Im not racist
Insides whiter than Katy Perrys face is

Look , fuck all that " Happy to be here " shit that yall want me on
Im the big homie , they still be tryna lil bro me , dog

When Im bout to drop somethin crazy and not say Im the greatest
Of my generation , like should be dressing different
Like should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like didnt study the game to the letter
And understand that Im not doin it the same
Man , Im doing it better
Like didnt make that clearer this year
Like should feel , dont know , guilty for saying that
They should put couple more mirrors in here
So can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that would share with myself
But thought " Fuck it "
Its worth it to share em with someone else other than Paris for once
text her from time to time , she mom now
guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
told her she could live with me if she need to
got compound but think shes straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the back room where was rapping with Jas over beats that shouldnt have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later , Im his artist
He probably wouldnt remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldnt believe when he called me
You never know , it could happen to you
And just spent four Ferraris all on brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause its somethin to do
Yeah , guess thats just who became , dog
Nothing was the same , dog

Hide til its bright out
Oh just another lonely night

Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so yeah had to act sane

When Im off track , mami is keepin me focused

Ill be there for you , if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me

Sometimes trip on how happy we could be
And so put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And promise Ill give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that breathe in , all that believe in
promise Ill give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

Young !

Young . . , fresh from Italy
Trip financed by my best ability
Same one helped me in extra realty
For my mom , for my nephews , bunch of lil mes
Flip flop by Versace , hip-hop got me here
Music made me millionaire , yeah
Multi for whats inside of here
Inside my heart besides that , Im smart
Prepare poems with passion , at the same time cash in
Took the best of both worlds minus the madness
Though controversy follows me everywhere dock
Everything hear block
Out like the jealous clouds do the sun
Then sit back and recline since my shine has shone
And then sure nuff bust out something foreign with the doors up
Maybe the lilac Porsche
The lavender Retriever
only bring my homies back purple reefer
only smoke in Ibiza
In Capri , somewhere foreign that you need your visa
Yup , Hovis home ; but its like never left , had the global phone
Yup , yeah stayed in touch
heard yall back home complaining yall complain too much
So hateful bunch of dudes put on out there acting so ungrateful
But daddys home , and he brought the forty autie-matie chrome
For all the chatty-chatty yall been doing

While yall was running your mouth complaining about Summer Jam
was in flip-flops in the South of France
See how it flip-flops with the number one station for hip-hop and & ?
You thought Summer Jam was starring you ? It was starring me
Even in my absence , my presence is felt
That gotta tell you Im the king , dog , if nothing else
Im on another continent , you still aint content
Im in the Mediterranean , you still aint vent
Explain to me why want to be you again
You on the radio crying , Im learning to swim
This is the 10 year anniversary of the Black Album , and its really special for me , as Im sure it is for lot of people . think everyone has an album or two that defines their musical taste , and sets the path for what youll listen to in the future . You always have an emotional connection to the music you listened to in your high school years . Its when we are the most passionate about our music choices . You didnt put your favorite passage from book in your AIM away message , you copied and pasted your favorite line from your favorite song

Growing up in suburb in the 90s , wasnt exposed to early hip hop like NWA and Wu Tang right away ( dont worry , caught up ) . All my friends listened to rock , whether it was Green Day , Incubus , 311 , stuff like that . And dont get me wrong , LOVE what the 90s represented for rock , its probably one of the strongest decades any genre ever had . But that also meant the only Hip Hop albums had when was 10 , 11 , 12 were Big Willie Style and maybe the Dangerous Minds soundtrack . just didnt know any better yet , call it youthful ignorance

My mom used to literally sit me down and wed listen to albums bought front to back with the lyrics booklet out because she didnt want me having music with swears and drug references and all that . hated it at the time , but you have to respect it now . So because of that , Hip Hop just wasnt an option for me until got past that age , unless snuck CD into the house . My little brother and used to borrow CDs from our friends , and rip them to cassette or my Sony MiniDisc player . Ludas Word of Mouf got confiscated from us MULTIPLE times

Because was only listening to albums was " allowed " to buy up to that point , loved music , but never CONNECTED with it . It hadnt spoken to me yet , as far as me being able to relate what was going on in my life to the lyrics . Now , Im not trying to say grew up the same way some of these hip hop artists did , because didnt . have an amazing family and my dad always provided for us , but was frustrated by how little he was around at the time , and Jay was talking about that specifically . Songs like " December 4th " showed me that hip hop was about storytelling , whereas lot of the pop music at the time was very bubble gum and generic . It felt so real , like putting on those headphones took you to different place , and sometimes you need that kind of escape as teenager

The Black Album to me , aside from being probably one of the or greatest , if not THE greatest hip hop albums , represents time in my life where my personality was being shaped . Everyone in high school is trying to figure out who they are , and music helps to define you , whether you like it or not . 10 years later , and " PSA " is still the most played song in my iTunes library . Did know what " . . . use to move snowflakes by the O-Z " meant at the time ? Probably not . But knew every Hov song front to back , and throughout the years , Id hear line and go " OHHHH thats what he meant ! " . Hip Hop was like watching documentary to me , because it showed me how other kids lived in parts of the world hadnt seen or experienced and opened my eyes and ears to other peoples struggles , as well as successes

The Black Album was Greatest Hits collection in itself . feel like people always downgrade newer albums in an artists catalog , simply because " their old stuff was better " . Take step back and isolate it , and youll find its an all time great . In his CRWN interview with Elliot Wilson , Hovs protege . Cole speaks on this infatuation with an artists early work , and how you can never top your early work in the minds of your core , longtime fans because they feel type of ownership of it . Because they were the first out of their crew to listen to you as an artist , they will always hold the early stuff up on pedestal . But Jay wasnt the same person in 2003 that he was in 1996 when Reasonable Doubt came out . He had new problems , and new stories to tell . It was marketed as his last album , because he had said he was retiring after its release . This made you savor every minute of it . felt like was losing friend , and wanted to make sure soaked in every word , every line , so would be satisfied at the end and could remember later in life how special it was

It may not seem like it , but Hip Hop is still so young . Weve seen so many changes happen in the culture in only few decades , so its hard to compare different eras of Hip Hop . But were the first generation that embraced hip hop fully . Our parents dont completely understand it as genre because they only hear the drug references , or the sometimes vulgar lines about women . They dont get past that because they grew up in time where that kind of content wasnt commonplace . But because our generation is little more desensitized to the language , we can listen to it and receive the message that the artist intended . Do rappers objectify women and talk about drugs ? Yeah , sure . But so did the Beatles , Rolling Stones , and Hendrix . Once you pull back that top layer , Hip Hop is what music has always been and always will be . . . peek into someones soul , in the hopes that you relate , connect , and use it as guide to find your own way through lifes ups and downs . And for me , if you had to ask me what singular album helped me through some of the best and worst times in my life , it was the Black Album

Happy Anniversary Hov

" No matter where you go , you are what you are player
And you can try to change , but thats just the top layer
Man , you was who you was fore you got here
Only God can judge me , so Im gone
Either love me , or leave me alone . "
No more reasonable doubt Ive proven to be the illest MC
Somthings wrong wit ya motor skills cause yall aint movin me
Im who you see musically when you want it done hot
Comparin you to me is lesson in futility stop
paint pictures beautifully but niggas is near sighted
Dont worry about plagiarism itll take them years to bite it
Which the greatest fears dont write it
It just appears outta thin air like the information obtained by physic
Like it or not pay dues and expect to be paid back
Why the fuck should freestyle Im gettin paid to rap
sling track laid back almost till its sin
Tell ya god somebodys doin good job impersonatin him
J-Hova spittin game from the Range Rover
What tha fuck is yall doin in da third lane get over
Slow ya rode up got it sewed up like tella
Relatively easy like Jerry Heller
Cream is cherry vanilla got chicks in da telli
Belly up soundin like mayhelia tryna tell yall
Yall know da style burn da town
Down and change the locale Im doin da same shit except its legit

Got twenty cart shorty better play that shit
You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit
Got twenty bag son better blaze that shit
They said wasnt seeing twenty but made dat shit

Pimp Gotti get da dues in them double down
Like them kids with tips who tops down
Bricks who get money quick see me
Representin bomb city on da bill block rockin mics
Before they get mill sold pills all night
The illest outta life got my mind on fate
Cause even on tour nigga still aint safe
keep tre eight on my left smoke for stress countin dirt bag lex
be da like malcom puff for now dunn east side represent wit tons of guns
You keep it real where you from
Cause where you at might put da dagger in yo back
Its like livin wit yo homey that be on crack
And fact my niggas know my styles phat like hoes in da El Dorado
My mind toatin fuck em duck em
Any thing but da main gun dont trust em


am the writer of the third verse and it goes :
Cool with the nigga huh , Fro main chiller
Berg shit , word shit , splurge with scrilla
Absurd when you word spit bird shit killa
Not to be perturbed with , herb shit dilla
Bust rap or bust cap hustla , stop flinching
You fresh off the corner calling dog shit , raw shit
Soon as he feel that soft shit he be like aww shit
Yaw broke niggas resot to glass looking
Opposites attract ass whooping
present the black class hooker , the fat ass booker
Cripple ya staff triple ya cash hash cookers
The past aint never the last to teach lessons
My peeps fucking up in the streets ? Keep guessing
Lotta kids coming out the wrong way like c-sections
Fuck weed cop coke cause the shit cost more
Thats why niggas say floss too much but
When take it off and such they say lost my touch
But bitches like the money wear , its funny how they stare
Dumb bunnies with their cunning little glare
She hit me with feline ( fee-line ) young cat , kitten
My boy hit that shit , now everybody splitting





Best of luck and health !

Without the eight , right , maybe you could test my weight , right

Adminster pain , next the ministers screaming your name
At your wake as peek in , look in your casket
Feeling sarcastic , " Look at him , still sleeping "

His favorite rapper wasnt rapping till he heard me

And Rakims Paid in Full
Rappers really gettin paid in full
So full that the kids dont go to school in hopes of becomin one of us
The only requirement is your bus
Now college is lookin slim , product is hookin them
Before their brains fully develop they get enveloped by the the vision tele
The television tells them their vision
Now its hard for them to make decisions with out feelin
Uncooled , unschooled , thumb rule
Rule of thumb , cant be dumb
wish wouldve studied abroad
Well studied broad and she studied me back
And my course was hard
That was that , this is this , listen up
Cause all Im saying is
If thirtys the new twenty , thirtys the new twenty for them wheels as well
They lookin for the mic or some pills to sell
While the girls are steady graduatin
Niggas standin on the corner hatin , debatin
Well should get the new Js or the Kobes
And they rollin so they wide awake for four days
Ha , Im G-entleman , lets get re-aquainted

Playground king , climb the monkey bars that built

And if catch ghost rider , tie him to tree , gasoline like the lighter
Burn , you motherfuckin fighta , treat you like George Bush treat Al-Qaeda

Rocafella forever Hov for life
Debuts classic first album four mics
Shoulda gotta five but niggas lack foresight
But dont giva fuck aint do it for the hype
do it for the hustlas for the ghetto for their plight
For the struggle for those who bubble white
For fly four by fours , roofless cars , flawless ice
For the pain for yall to know what its like
For every time it rains 40 days and 40 nights
For every promise made that never saw the light
Ill get my own forty acres give me four nights
Four os Glock forty for the jackers and Im Spike
Or the four four will suffice
fourteen year old to look out for the vice
You can sit back and just wait for the flight
Boy will take off like Ive been strippin all my life
Thats the type of metaphors write
That let niggas know was real before the mic
Four front rows had the fur at the fight
No PETA on my Peter left some room for the divas
In the suite well meet up if you wild for the night
On the rampage champagne pours on the floor
For all those who aint make it here and lost they life
Wouldnt forget yall for any price
Not for no hoes not for no ice
Not for no fame nor for bright lights
So Imma end this here real mean but Im right

Yo , got slugs for snitches , no love for bitches
Putting thugs in ditches when my trigger finger itches
got rep that make police jet , known to get priest wet
never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat
Is Big slow , hell no
Bitches get fucked on the roof when aint got no hotel dough
Im known for yokin Japs and beating em with smoking gats
Leaving token Blacks with broken backs and open caps
So with that bullshit , step to the rear son
The last thing you want with Big is fair one
Cause in street brawl strike men like lightning
You seen what happened in my last fight friend , aight then
beat kids with lead pipes , leave trails of dead mics
Where Im from , niggas jewels get ran like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided
Crimes are drug related
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about thousand volts
For selling pounds of coke
Front in this town and get tech stuck down your throat
Im telling you shit is about to get drastic soon
Im quick to blast goon and break mothafucker like plastic spoon
got the looks that make your hotty stare
keep shotty near , its that nigga with notty hair who Gotti fear
Tracks Im known to roast until the microphone is ghost
Props own the most , Im leaving niggas comatose
Front and get your brain pinched
Big will have your whole gang lynched
started smoking dust and been insane since
This rap shit was great gift
The other night some snake riffed and got hot lead facelift
All through high school had braids ; kept mad blades
Stabbing teachers to death that gave me bad grades
cook the mic like beef steak , cause my techniques great
And Im the nigga police hate in each state
Cause Im the neighborhood lamper , punk brother vamper
Fuck around , youll find my silk boxers in your mothers hamper
Cops drop when my Glock makes pow sound
Im from whyle town
You know my style clown , so bow down
Word up
95 style . . . got my man Jay-Z here

Brothers can beg and borrow , still feel sorrow
When Jay , like Zorro , get in that ass , better luck tomorrow
Im too much nigga , so never should you rush
You need slow down or get your ass tore down
Check it out , Im too cocky to stop me
You gotta kill me and when Im gone
You can still feel me , on the real ,
The shit is eternal , rock the heavens well
Even if they wont let me in Heaven , raise hell , till its Heaven
Recognize , the black cat with the nine lives
Get up off me nigga , its bad luck to cross me
Im popping Crystal , shooting game like missiles
As projected all hos affected by this style
mack like Goldie , go back like the oldie
But the goody
Pulling & bitches wearing hoodies
They dont be knowin the way be flowing
When be going , be running the track like Jesse Owens
disrupt the natural scheme , the way that you do things with swing
And have em rocking like , you say never you run , if ever you come
Its never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm
produce like jizm
Just like the gods start with knowledge and follow with wisdom
For greater understanding Im landing blows
And knocking sense into those that oppose me
Enticing when slicing through tracks
Your screaming , Jesus Christ hes back
And God knows he can rap
Me and put rhythm on the map so give him his dap
And me , just take mine
Gimme those , gimme this , gimme that , fuck that
You never see me stressed , in GS
On the prize , my greedy eyes cant see no less
Jigga incredible
Even my thoughts is federal
Like kidnapping , extortion and corruption
So you know , beating me will never come like nun or tomorrow
Im too thorough , nigga
make moves , cause bowels to move
When Im creeping through your way
With thousand little dudes
Armed with piece like Islam
make your eyes rise like yeast
Surprise , feel no fear when facing yall
Betcha lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcees trying to be the best
And even in dying , couldnt be this def
see no reason to stop cheesing
Ever since said throw three gs in
And we can get down and split the wealth
Thats when found could do it myself , get up

Purge

We are dying , we are dying
( Sometimes wanna purge )
We are dying
( Sometimes wanna purge )
We are dying , some times gotta purge
( Sometimes wanna )
Were living on purge
( Sometimes wanna )

What if we ran through Beverley Hills , got 70 kills
Ridin down Rodeo in the Chevy with pills
And pop one , load 12 slugs in the eagle
And shot one , Donald Sterling hopped in his Benz
got one , beam on the back of his dome
Palm sweaty on the back of the chrome
Thats my adrenaline
So we purge Sandusky , purge Zimmerman
Purge every mother fucker rapin women in
Purge niggas killin kids , back to back in two vans
Me and my mercenaries , middle of South Sudan
Carryin babies bodies , long as got two hands
Long as got two feet , millions and my crew deep
We purge for the families , they deaths aint in vein now
Crash my ass , niggas know who shot that plane down
298 innocent lives severed
Flyin on Aaliyahs wings all the way to heaven
And so we Purge


Imagine going to the stores without cops harrasing
Imagine Mike Brown walkin , them same cops just passed em
Im smokin hash , and let me ash it before talk in past tense
hope his mama tears is like acid to your fuckin badges
shots in his brain , in his fashion
Thinkin bout his casket in this Phantom , swear almost crashed it
Thats why Im headed to Ferguson with this German luger
Cause Im probably more like Nelson Mandela than Martin Luther
More like Ice than Ice Cube , Im cop killer
Murder all the cops , then the cops will probably stop killin
On my knees prayin , wish my nigga Pac was livin
But he fell victim to the Rampart Division , purge
Cops killed Biggie , cops beat up Rodney King
We tore up the city nigga , purge
Or just stand there like . Cole and shoot at cops in the same spot till the case closed , purge


This song is dedicated , to my engineer Jus wife , Carey Jean who passed away June 28th at . 45 pm to stomach cancer , days before his son Harlems 11th birthday . Crazy how he mournin his wifes death and Im celebrating my sons life . Ill never understand death , shit . Sometimes its struggle to understand life , shit crazy . Ill never understand . Cant stop fightin to survive though , but what we fightin for when we eventually all die though , purge . Eventually we all victims of the purge . Us killers , whats keepin us alive . Its question nobody got the answer to . So PURGE !

All in the streets , talkin bout you shot niggas
Then you went in New York Times , takin cop pictures
exposed you niggas and put out Stop Snitchin
When the last time you seen em with some hot bitches ?
See what he say when you ask him , " Where the hot bitches ? "
Check the Adams Apple , nigga them is not bitches
Youre reign on the top was shorter than the legs on leprechaun
Just bow down nigga , accept the Don
Nobody wanna be hero when the Tech is strong
Their transformers folding up like decepticons
Niggas bust like pipes when the pressure on
See that light flash when the desert eagle at your dome
Every rapper know from now , Imma set the tone
Niggas real hard body til they head is gone
Here come the demons , cos they know that you dead and gone
Some niggas just dont get it , til you at the throne

Everybody wanna know why he got beef
Cause in my dreams talked to Pac and . .
Got on the plane hopin that the NYC
Its me behind these bars like Chi-Ali
Niggas want me to D-i
Been there , done that
Woke up from coma on . Vs
Eyes on the thrown , somebody in my seat
Fiddlin with rap like Miri Ben-ari
scoop up Swizz , drive thru the Bronx and get Jada on the phone
My next stop is Yonkers
After that its Harlem , why ?
Cause im certified gangsta
And Jim Jones throwin Blood party
Red bandanas from 93rd to 115th and Lennox
Its the sequel to Menace
Oh Lord , he done went dogg
Made 50s beef his and knocked em both off


New aftermath chain on , thats the bling
Stones yellow and black he Latin King
Mira me king ton el jefe Simone
Translation : get money off ringtones
King Blood , even though used to sling drugs when see snoop he tell me " Keep doin your thing cuz "
do it cause love it
Do it for the niggas that dont know the difference between Chuck Taylors and chuckers
Im gangsta tell Remy Martin wanna fuck her
Thats what call championship game at the Rucker
Yall want beef ? change the subject
You aint got no stars like the flag of the Dominican Republic
After Angies show was finna to get the bus
And catch cab to house and ask any nigga hustlin
aint got to live in New York all my life to know the and train go to Washington Heights


Left the VMA awards , went back to the hood
Streets is talkin Game got slapped by Suge
False , was face to face wit him
Media wanna criticize the Game
Like he had Ma $ wit him
He hood nigga that aint ever try to snake niggas
Walk thru the boroughs never had jake with him
Bake it how want , aint no cupcake in him
Even Diddy know , make the city glow
Never had an album , never had his own video
was sellin crack while Ja was watchin 50 blow
White tee shirt , converse and my dickies on
Signed wit Dre recorded 150 songs
Now the fuckin hip hop police hatin
Tryin to run me outta New York like Anthony Mason
Nigga Ill come and erase you
Only nigga from california
Thatll come for they tongue wit razor

Baby this is real shit
My record sell slow , Imma show you my dick

Here the breakdown
No 400 bars yet , dont need that
Im gas , your whole click is ass , mean that
G-Unot cocksucker , better believe that
say it one time , watch the whole world scream back
G-U N-O , now thats for Billboard , rest in peace
And since my nigga died , been stressed , no sleep
Contemplating suicide in my Lexus jeep
tried twice but couldnt make my death complete
guess you could say Mya got the best of me
Came back from the dead to address the beef
Kiss my Converse bitch and accept defeat
Cause hate it when bullies try to test the weak
Thats when go Bishop in Juice and start flexin heat
You could get it in the stomach just like Raheem
Cause runnin with snitch is not quite my thing
tried to take Buck with me , but he stayed on the scene
Guess all can do now is pray for Supreme
While finish my next album , five million and countin
Anticipating , tellin the world did it without him
If Aftermath was family that didnt have mother
Id be Dres newborn , youd be the jealous older brother
Yea , daddy love us but in the meanwhile
You talkin behind his back and in his face you smile
You moved out the house , you failure now
And lil Game grew up to be problem child
whip yo head boy , thats for Kanye West
whip yo head boy , with the back of my tech
Yep , your fuckin group fell flat without me
You mad , what you gonna do , rap about me ?
Your bars is park garbage , hooks is mediocre
And your new shoes look like Reebok pennyloafers
Try to walk in my shoes block
Hurricanes in stores the day after Christmas , nigga fuck Reeboks
You steroid addict , you need detox
Hopefully you make it out in time to be on Detox
Cause Black Wall Street expandin , yeah bought three blocks
My CL so smooth , it should of came with Pete Rock
And lets not forget who made me hot
It was Dr . Dre that took me out the weed spot
You want credit , forget it , did it on my own
Gave you 300 bars , then said Im gone
But Im back , this is rap and fact is fact
They say once you turn snitch , you never go back
Heres picture of Ja Rule , motherfucker hold that
What goes around comes around , get used to the gold plaques
Homie got cheese , but he dont feed no rats
show the world my dick if Lloyd Banks go plat
Im lyrically insane , Lloyd Banks know that
He told me was like Big Daddy Kane throwback
Started with one brick , built my own company
And dont spread news about it unless it come from me
Guess whos the boss , nigga my squad deep
But Glasses Malone is not signed to Black Wall Street
Nigga dont , dont , dont , dont , dont believe the hype
Hear that Mike ?
And dont be alarmed , this is not diss
But missusing my logo kinda got me pissed
And got enough beef , now Lil Eazy dissin
He dont write his own raps , so gotta forgive him
got love for ya pops and always will
So on behalf of Eric Wright , my nigga you gotta chill
Im the reason you new westcoast niggas got deal
While was doin mixtapes , they was watching College Hill
For real , you mothafuckas aint got half my skill
run this shit like OJ and pass for the bills
Trying so hard to be gangsta , nigga you seethrough
Posing like 50 on the cover of the GQ
Button up shirt with the cut off sleeves
got twin Desert Eagles , nigga suck on these
got that CEO flow , yea my bars are sweet
Like Hova in Takeover , chewin out Mobb Deep
Like Pac on Hit Em Up , chewin out Mobb Deep
Dont one of you niggas got sickle ? Fuck it , talk is cheap
When see you , and Im gonna see you
Imma strip you down asshole naked and thats how Imma leave you
Then Imma find Havoc , make him walk through Queens nude
With Black Wall Street tattooed on his back
Nigga signed to G-unit , now they bustin guns
But last week it was : " My nigga Game , what up dun ? "
See thats what the fuck mean , you cant trust these rap niggas
And you wonder why always say fuck these rap niggas
So Imma break it down for MCs and friends
If you dont hear your name , let the beef begin
Aint got shit against Hov , like the niggas style
Nas is my nigga , been bangin him for while
fuck with Fat Joe , he got the streets locked
And thats the same reason fuck with Kiss and D-Block
Place Eminem in the number three spot
And Snoop is like my big brother , we both raised by the Doc
Young Jeezy you hot , we both new to this
While Im in the ATL , shout out to Ludacris
Cause your uncle Scarface show me that crime pays
Just like Paul Wall got me sittin sideways
And cant forget about the homie Mike Jones
Who ? Mike Jones , Skeet screw the fuckin song
fuck with Slim Thug and my nigga Bun
Cant do that without saying free Pimp
And thats the reason why 50 try to pimp me
So went window shoppin and bought two Bentleys
Im in the drivers seat , motherfucker dont tempt me
Turnin Spider Loc against me , cause your scared to come get me
Cuz know whats up , Bloods still got love for em
Come to the block , Ill shake off the rub for em
Ask for G-unit , motherfucker its wrap
Mase made it out alive , thank God for that
If Dipset dont get you , Jesse Jackson will
And if all else fails , Ill see you in hell
Wear that G-unit spinner when you come to .
have nigga parkin cars , dressed up like valet
He gonna turn back pastor when the gun in his face
The real chain still in Chicago when Im takin the fake
You can call who you want , aint givin back shit
Unless Olivia show the whole world she got dick
Cant seem to save her life , but she talk lot of shit
And want my ten Gs cause Yayo caught brick
guess my G-Unot tattoo was smart move
Cause in the end you lost hundred mill to cartoon
Three years after you got tatted by Cartoon
The beef is over , G-Unit gonna fall apart , soon

Hahahahaha
Faggot ass niggas
guess win nigga
Life is game of chess nigga
Some king , some queens
Lloyd Banks , Tony Yayo , Young Buck , Pastor fuckin Mase
You niggas is pawns
50 , or Boo Boo , or Curtis , or Chicken Little , hahaha
The DVD , its tell all motherfuckers
Yeah , my documentaries be better than your movies nigga , hahaha
drove by your house nigga
Go buy the DVD , $16.99 nigga
At your local record store , Blockbuster , Sam Goody , Warehouse
Shout out to the moms and pops , for helping me slay them faggots
G-gu g-g gu , G-gu g-g gu , G-gu g-g gu , G-Unot ! Hahahaha
Pop off nigga , hahahaha , pop off nigga , pop off
Its me , The G-A M-E , gone
{ * plane soars overhead * }
Ay ay ay ay . . . { * echoes * }

Cal-i forn-ia , hope-you got-your gun
If-not call-one eight-hundred , HOMICIDE
One-eight hundred , HOMICIDE
Cal-i forn-ia , when-you need-us
You-can call-us one-eight hundred , HOMICIDE
One-eight hundred , HOMICIDE

Im motherfuckin Aftermath nightmare , wake up motherfucker
traded in my black Nike Airs
For white pair of Converse , Dre let me bomb first
Get out on bail and still make the concert
Ask Eminem , homey Im Shady
Too much West coast dick lick it , remember Jay-Z ?
" The Chronic " and " Doggystyle " raised me
My life like rock , it was based in the 80s
Red bandana tied around my face
hope the shit dont jam is how gangsters pray
And if God forgives the nigga that shot Suge
Then all dawgs should go to heaven in my hood
resurrected this gangster shit
And this the motherfuckin thanks get ?
Every city got Crips and Bloods
But since Pac died it aint been no " California Love "

Nigga dont sweat the date , my moms is late
So had to plan my escape , out the skins
In this world , the fly girl
Tanqueray or Hennessy until called Earl
Ten months in this gut , what the fuck
wish moms would hurry up so could get buck
While , Juvenile rippin mics and shit
New York , New York ready for the likes of this
Uh , then came the worst date , May , 21st
: 19 is when my mamas water burst
No spouse in the house , so she rolls herself
To the hospital , to see if she could get little help
Umbilical chords wraped around my neck
Im seein my death , and aint even took my first step
made it out , Im bringin mad joy
The doctor looked and said " Hes gonna be Bad Boy . "

Would Pac be alive , if you let Pac drive ?
Swear to God , to reverse , that Ill give my Left Eye
With the right Ill visualize the king of Bed-Stuy
Checkin his daughter , Tyanna into junior high
If was in Brooklyn and . . was still alive
In 2006 , it might sound like this
NY , 7-1 8s , 2-1 2s
With Sues rendezvous , its like Moulin Rouge
High fashion , uptown Air Force Ones and Vasquez
Puerto Ricans with fat asses
Blazed dutch masters , we dump ashes
On models in classes for you bastards
Catch cab to Manhattan , with that Broadway actin
You hype , that Belly shitll get you capped and wraped in plastic
Tell the captain to ask Rog Whats Happenin ?
hear , nor speak no evil inside the magnum

Now Im thirteen , smokin blunts makin cream
On the drug scene , fuck the football team
Riskin ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin the coach scream , made my lifetime dream
mean , wanna blow up , stack my dough up
So school , didnt show up , it fucked my flow up
Ma said that should grow up , and check myself
Before wreck myself , disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf , nah , couldnt see it
Scarface , king of New York , wanna be it
Rap was secondary , money was necessary
Until got incarcerated , kinda scary
Seat 74 , Mart set me straight
Not able to move , behind great steel gate
Time to contemplate , damn , where did fail ?
All the money stacked , was all the money for bail

What the fuck is all this noise ?
He from Cali , he cant rap
He aint better than this nigga
Thats my favorite artist
Fuck yall , hear the breakdown . .


No detox , Im comfortable dog
Like the solo Reeboks right up under me dog
And it feel like done it before
Sit in the throne pollutin the airwaves like Hummer exhaust
Dont let Makaveli fool you homie , thugging it costs
Pour out little liquor for the loved ones that we lost
You aint gotta wait for the album dont fuck with The Source
But turn up my Eazy-E and let it bump in the Porsche
mean turn up my . . . and let it bump in the Porsche
Tell em to roll red carpet when he come in New York
Hip-hop police on me think they runnin New York
Till lace my Air1 show em how to run in New York
They tryin to take me downtown put me under the court
Cause Joe Buddens told em carry gun in New York
And homey thats strictly fact , he got ripped on wax
So he snitched just to get me back
No matter what you say dog , your shit be whack
You better watch what you say , it might get you clapped
Heres little advice , homie : switch your raps
Cause that shit on your last album aint get you plat
What nigga you need gun ? Ill get you that
P-89 nigga let Dre stitch you back
It aint an industry , niggas admit to that
But dont even want your chain , Ill let the Crips do that
12 bars for that bitch , he wont live through that
Even nigga with ten year bid knew that
Put gun in his mouth yeah , yeah do that
He pussy ( sniff , sniff ) his own kid knew that
Im Ready To Die , . . . knew that
He aint eatin , look at his white tee you could see his ribs through that
You cocksucker , let your ears do that
Or ride later do me ooh wee now back to rap
Lincoln Continentals sittin back to back
Leavin Jersey City naw nigga , Hackensack
Wheres that ? Somewhere where the crackers at
Real far from where the roaches and rats is at
Come to Compton Ill show you where the racquets at
Down the street from the Staples Center where they Hack-a Shaq
Give the advance money back , aint have to rap
Break Harry-O out tell him crack is back
Thats nine five bird take half of that
Import it , export it in cracker jacks
When you get to the projects , ask for Black
You know what you started with ? Give him half of that
He gon give you 50 Gs in plastic sack
And Imma give you , 500 cash for that
Gotta keep your mouth closed or Imma blast the mac
They wont believe you the whole world know that bastard rap
Once youre out of the throne , you cant have it back
Retirement home and aint nothing after that
Except you layin in casket , black suit on
You cant go to heaven with Timberland boots on
No subliminals , aint talkin to you Shawn
Im talkin to that heartless mouse with no jewels on
Who the fuck put you on
Faggot ass nigga let men toss his salad like croutons
fuck with Fab , get my DJ Clue on
Sit inside Hot 97 with no tools on
And it dont matter if its Sway or Kay Slay
Angie Martinez Ill take em back to KDAY
They act like they forgot about Dre-day
dont rap for Free thats why they fired AJ
Its me leaking through your stereo
Envy me as an MC , prepare for your burial
kill niggas without lettin the Desert blow
Razor tongue and Im far from Haitian son
All black like the Range Rover wheels
Niggas whisper around The Game like The Game wont kill
Let me show you the stars , take you back to the car
Rewind time , March , 1994
was only in my teens , deuce-deuce in my Levis
When Nas hit the scene was still rockin knee-highs
Runnin with my brother Fase , he was 17
Two guns in the upper waist , so we hit the block
Saw niggas from rival gang bumpin Dre
Ran up on the 64 and thats all she wrote
We runnin through the alley like Bishop chasin Radames
First murder and did that without mask
Fast-forward , see Game gettin out Jag
Two piece suit on , he still got his rag
Gangbangin forever , he still got his swag
Let me catch you in Los Angeles without pass
Everybody in New York know that you fag
Come out the closet , show the world how to use pad
Speakin death on my red bandana
Naw , he couldnt have said that , so raised my antennas
Look at my Nextel , got call from Santana
That nigga pussy , we just saw him in Atlanta
So hopped on the first thing smokin to Atlanta
Pulled up at 112 ran up on that black Phantom
Security hopped out , no Joe in here
Just Outkast gettin ready for show in here
So uncocked the . 44
Hopped in the cherry low-low
Chrome grill with the G-Unit logo
We watched Hov go , now the world waitin for my solo
Im the man , Stat Quo know
aint gotta explain , even Bo know
Half of these rap niggas is faker than rolls gold
Get hit in the face with the back of the . 44
And pissed on tryin to play The Game with broke nose
My bitch harder than you , yeah Vida loco
aint sold one record got rap in chokehold
Im Dre certified like the leader of the band
Run up , you sure to die , Ill leave you where you stand
Smurf-ette runnin around New York like he the man
But he peed in his pants when he saw us at Summer Jam
Lucky wasnt there , had to bury my man
Or wouldve terrorized New York like the Son Of Sam
" What you mean terrorize New York ? "
mean expose these pussy ass niggas like Im Too $ hort
Somebody tell Domination Ill leave him in parts
Leg in Jersey , arm in Brooklyn , head buried in Central Park
He cant walk through New York no more like John Stark
Got call cause Im break his ankles like Hot-Sauce
Ask niggas from your hood Im thorough in boroughs
Sit on any stoop , Pelli Tims in the thermal
Wait till Alpo come home
Like Azie from Harlem , Dre gon pay me regardless
Cause he know Jay-Z departed
And these other rap labels know dont feed they artists
Talkin blueprint shit you got three garages
Gettin money off Roc like little and Carter
Showin off your little chain like these is flawless
Send him 50 cent day can see he starvin
Deep massages , could hear Eazy talkin
Tellin me to have seat in Tomicas office
Buy Ruthless and get Lil involved in
Promote without that magazine in Boston
Take couple mil , make Beans offer
Give him money we dont see that often
But it was all dream , like seen Memph Bleek in Marcy
aint say you wont see Bleek in Marcy
said my man told me he dont see Bleek in Marcy
Im from Compton where niggas used to bleed for Barkleys
Drive lo-los and we aint need keys to start em
Just little information for your summer vacation
Bring your chain cause every nigga in . . waitin
Mad cause Detroit beat the shit out the Lakers
And theyll kill you cause they cant find Gary Payton
Meanwhile the throne vacant and Da Band aint makin it
Shyne got new deal , Def Jam gotta pay us
Playboy Jones got knocked out shortly after they weighed him in
Niggas got beef with G-Unit but aint sayin shit
Quiet as church on Tuesdays
Niggas say they hate my music , but my alerts on they 2-ways
Nigga Im hazard like Michael Jackson in khakis
Touch kids but do that with semi-automatic
With or without traffic pull my shit out and blast it
Im blind to the masses like Stevie Wonder without glasses
Im savage spit murder like . 38 Magnum
16 barsll baggum let the hook toe tag em
Murder any MC throw em in that white wagon
Let him die and come back look at em , he white flaggin
Spreadin rumors like , " When see Game might jack him "
Im tellin the world : he reach for my chain , might clap him
Cause niggas shot me in 2001
Took one in the heart cause was too proud to run
The clip was empty when the police found my gun
So dont bring that gangbangin shit around my son
Nigga 50 took he know how it feel
And found out Buck got shot up in Cashville
And Sha Money told me Lloyd Banks got hit
And Yayo just came home ( G-G G-Unit )
Backstage at D-12 concert
fan asked me how it feel to be walkin in Snoops Converse
Niggas show me love when they see me in the streets
But they frown when dont want to hear none of they beats
Nigga , this shit crazy
Em said some shit when was 16 , now they tryin to ruin Slim Shady
forgive him , got problems of my own
How you think the streets gon act now that Suge got home
These niggas is birds , can see the feathers on em
If Doc give me the word , put this Berretta on em
When the beef is on , my piece is on
White sheets is on em , Doc breathin on em
And got an extra clip in my Reeboks
Cause Im in and out my socks every time see cops
Game got the streets locked
Call 911 , get the whole fuckin LAPD shot
Niggas snitchin to the street cops
Get your nephews and your niece shot
When my heat cocked , then the beat stop
Nigga with attitude like heard Dr . Dre doin " Detox "
Niggas fightin for the throne that aint shit
Tryin to measure the fallin legends but the shoe wont fit
Niggas might think Im ridin dick
Cause Im at the cemetery puttin creases in my G-Units
Tryin to talk to Jesus Christ into lettin me dig em up
So they could stand side by side again and live it up
This might be the last time you hear me biggin em up
With " Suicidal Thoughts " bangin me and my bitch in the truck
My conscience tellin me if put the clip in the buck
It might be loud enough to wake . . and them up
What if that was . Diddy sittin in the truck
And 2Pac was in jail the day he recorded " Hit em Up " ?
wouldnt be outside 40 / 40 bumpin Jigga What
Wouldnt be signed to Dr . Dre , wonder is it luck
They got me on MTV with Banks , Fifth , and Buck
aint tryin to be . . king , he carry pimp cup

Snoop Dogg got the crown , nigga
What the fuck yall mad at me for ?
aint sold one fuckin record
Im just tryin to use these 200 bars to feed my family , nigga
aint no threat
cant rap , Im from Compton remember ?
You gotta be out your motherfuckin mind
Ask Kay Slay , ask Clue , ask Whoo Kid , ask Funk Flex
Ill murder anyone of you motherfuckers
G-G G-G Unit

Now . . aint sayin that you dope nigga . .
But you better than spider loc Nigga . . .
Fifty saw the opportunity and thought he could use him

You got the west on your back ? you lyin bastard

What the hell made you think you could fuck wit the game
When yo claim to fame was Yukmouths chain
Take my advice and lay low
Heard you and your uncle Yayo
Got ran the fuck outta san diego
Ill give you shots when the 38 blow
Leave hole in your chest . . the size of bagel
We can do it when you say so
Wait till the Lakers on the road , shoot it out at the staples
Open your chest , show the world what you made of
My dick hard cant wait till the day come
When can put the infared on him
Let billboard rest , dont speak on my dead homie
All you new west coast niggas chill
The city is mine , Eazy left it to me in his will

was sentenced to album deal in 02
Spent the next couple years trying to figure out who was who
Met this New York nigga they called him Boo Boo
So we chopped it on the yard and he put me down with his crew
We was the hardest niggas in the penitentiary
Got little bigger since Jimmy Iovine sentenced me
Sat back in my cell and wrote The Documentary
aint make no friends in jail , just enemies
lot of bad memories , fucked up tendencies
Even bumped heads with this Young Buck from Tennessee
Say he got connects in Nashville got them 10 key
Shit , we finna see , nigga knew been
Never needed The Unit , thats how them niggas remembered me
Yo . . coming Imma holla in minute
Niggas on the yard tripping , aint got the energy
Had couple jail fights them niggas couldnt finish me


25 to life
No fucking Parole
Just animals in this bitch and aint trusting soul
So while im up in here might as well make the best of it
And pray to the lord he take care of the rest of it
25 to life
Got me feeling like im stuck
Only reason survived because dont give fuck
Nothing but bad luck
And aint never cried tear
Never going home , nigga fuck around and die here


Im getting sick and tired of these newcomers
Ive been locked up for more than few summers
Still gotta do numbers , still gotta do numbers
Looking at pictures of Keri Hilson on the wall , dick hard as cucumber
Relax my mind , hit the yard and shoot few jumpers
Really wanna shoot something , who the fuck wanna do something
This lifer named esco
Told me was the hardest nigga to ever hit the yard since Pac was on Death Row
Im about to go fuck with my niggas on block
Cause he know what to do when these niggas be taking cheap shots
Ask nigga how long he got , he said about
Then we start having conversations about Shyne
Homie just got out , shit its about time
We click cause he about his and nigga im about mine
So not near nigga here can talk about Shyne and Lil Wayne neither
Get your pussy ass outlined



Niggas aint stopping me
Especially with me and my nigga Beans from state property
could feel it in the air
Niggas up in here is scared
Niggas up in here is queers
Niggas up in here is dead

Snitches get stitches thats the type of shit we do in here
Who the fuck is you in here
You fucking with killer
Better have lion heart fucking with dealer
Reputations get ruined here play the game to win
Guns , pack 10 , the UCLA Bruin here
None of you fresh fish niggas couldnt do year
Let alone life sentence

Nigga Lyfe Jennings
Lloyd tried to rob my bank and got his fucking life ended

Now , theres the speaker , bring your ears little closer
Before you call this diss , and you make Hova pissed

That was taught if nigga take shots to shoot back
Defending his yard , yeah standing his ground
Im saying if you gonna retire , then hand me the crown
Nah , let Bleek do it , then throw him concert in Madison Square
Watch everybody sleep through it
We can go bar for bar , Ill let the lines speak to em
What they say ? Bleek is over , let Chris and Neef do it
They say the wrong thing , Imma smack em silly
What you thought ? Them was the only niggas that rapped in Philly ?
See them niggas with the sunnis leave you wrapped in Philly
Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly
Copped the cab call said Curtis Jack in Philly
Make U-turn , gotta go back to Philly
forgot my cheese steak , thats what told the cops
So they wouldnt get the dogs start searching for the Glock
And cant forget , . . . got murdered by the cops
Even was ready to die , when heard that he was shot
Whats beef ? Beef is when murk you on the spot
Labels signing anything , still searching for they Pac
put purple on the block
So dont feel threatened when Ludacris say he coming for the number one spot
Ask 50 , it get lonely on top
You can hate me or love me , but now the cops the only homies he got
When its beef we eat , we win , but we aint lonely , we pop
You sell records but G-g g-U not
Acting big on the radio , to me you not
You can ask Mister Cee who hot
Tony Yayo bet 10 Gs you flop
Run up on that new 300 you got
Stop hoping fall , hope the bleeding stop
And hope you blackout before you see the cops

So got my high tops that make your breathing stop
Im gangsta slash rapper , check your CD shop
Im like Elvis in there , they cant believe you dropped
Now Im moving on up to George and Weezys spot

saw the west coast , put the shit on my back
Sprayed Aftermath on it , then loosened the strap
It get hot in here , let Lucifer rap
Bring hell to niggas when Dre producing track
Take it to the streets , put the duece-duece to your hat
Then call up the pigs , tell them the roosters back
Call Jadakiss , tell him that duke is back
Im still by your side , no matter who comes strapped
Fuck Lloyd Banks , it aint about who can rap
Its about when the Ruger clap , is rufus back
see what you thinkin , you want me to die , is that so ?
Now you left leaning back , thanks to Fat Joe
We got reservations in heaven , you ready ? Lets go
Drop them off , then Pop Crystal like Esco
Im say he hit me first if me and Dre talk
All Nas said back was he had braveheart
Now thats the eulogy , beef is kinda foolish , see
Niggas running their mouth about what the fuck they gon do to me
But quit the yapping before proceed to clapping
And you gon see the captain with plans of getting me captured
Even behind bars , Im still gon shine
Im ten years younger than Yayo , get out , Im fine
Then go right back , nigga pop mines
How you gon drop Olivia , you only drop dimes
knew you changed , when you started sleeping in that vest dog
dont need 50 Cent , my niggas make collect calls
1-800 split faggot nigga wig
He got G-Unit wings , throw them off the Queens Bridge
Now your career is over , career is over
We in QB , banging CNN in the rover
T-O N-Y , thats the Capone NORE
You aint the talk of New York , your sixteens is boring
Take that shit off nigga , go back to PC
And tell 50 Cent you want copy of Beef
Im airing their ass out on DVD
You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks , repeat after me
Im G-Unit toy soldier
On Sesame Street doing voice overs
Bitch ass nigga need rhyme dictionary , to rehearse his lines
Sound like Oscar the Grouch , with them nursery rhymes
We was in the studio , when first got signed
He got stuck , he called 50 , tryna borrow some lines
Thats the wrong nigga , when you need help with your rhymes
All he gon tell you is say G-Unit one more time
Got mad cause aint wanna make your beef mine
You got lucky with Ja , why you aint go at Shyne ?
He freestyled from the pen , thats just the fact
Said hed put you with your mom , and you aint fucked with that
Then you lied about your pops , he aint never bust no cap
Like father , like son , go ask Busta that
knew from the beginning couldnt trust those cats
Id kill em all , if could bring Justo back
The underground is mine , treat it like home
Its the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine , treat it like home
Its the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine , treat it like home
Its the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
said
The underground is mine , treat it like home
Its the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
And Im far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it
Do whatever to it , put it in the store the shit moving
Gave em hundred bars , they aint think could do it
Came with two hundred , nigga this is more than music
Even Dre knew it , that boy hot like summer
Both feeth in the dirt , 300 Bars and Runnin
And beef with any nigga , say my name motherfucka , Im gunnin
You can put it on Skee if you want it
Ill air you out on Drama King , Mike , or Clue
And watch them shits sell out like Air Jordon shoe
told Funk Flex when catch the nigga Whoo Kid
We gon see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs
Dont hit me on the sidekick asking what you did
Get gun or ask 50s police to use his
Cause Bloods gonna get ya
Bloods , Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain
That 380 spill brains , when pop shots
Outside NY , in front of hip-hop cops
Or broad day in . . , Imma tell Em and Dre
This nigga bootlegging my music , aint nothing for him to say
Took me off my own songs , then put it on his tapes
So Imma take him out his house , put the beam on his face
Drop him off at Terror Squad , let him scream for the jakes
Cause when you fucking with Jayceon , you can bleed in the lake
For caking off niggas on them CDs and tapes
Ask them to scratch record , you will see he fake
If 50 was Puffy , youd run and go get him cheese cake
Take the DJ off your name , Mr . Instant replay
Not the instant replay
mean the machine that G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like
Bitches only feel your shit just lil bit
Niggas only feel your shit just lil bit
On my album , 50 helped me just lil bit
Only on two songs , now back to some killer shit
My clips bananas , kill gorilla quick
Beating on your chest , see to your death , yep
Tell Ecko to make him suit
Tell Reebock to make him some boots
Get him head band , to cover the holes in his head
He dead man for thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman
Banks blacked out and let the gun blam without M-E T-H O-D Man
So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings
Take my advice , never wear Air Max for the dreams
Unless you one of the Bloods , or Latin King
Cause if your left with the Aryans your ass will sting
And your cellmate is 25 to lifer
They will stab you in Folsom , then fuck you on Rikers
And life goes on
Now back to the coward of the hour , who lied and said he write my songs
He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf
So he gave me all his hits , you shouldve kept them for yourself
Nigga stop acting tough before stand over you
Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre
Make move Im blasting your ass to the last one
Ten shots from the MAC empty the rest in the passenger
Fase yelling thats enough , let the coroner bag him up
Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum
Gun smoking , Fase think Im locin backing up
Reverse the 05 hearse on 41st and traffic , what
Hip-Hop cops on my left , but pass em up
The Dodge got Hemi in it , Game got Remy in em
In and out of lanes like New York cab
miss the old king that new york had
Whos this fake nigga , on pictures with the Jake nigga ?
Got his crew starving cause he ate the whole cake , nigga
He aint Nas , aint . . . , aint Jigga
If he aint Cube or Pac then who you got ?
We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot
Ill use another six bars to tell you who you not
You aint 50 Cent , he went out like gangsta
You went out with Vivica , three months after Wanksta
Get Rich or Die Tryin , we thought you was hot
Now the same nigga wanna take us to the Candy Shop
Cmon man , what happened to the thug ?
Now you could find in the club , him and Lloyd Banks hugging
Nigga got mad when The Game start buzzing
So fuck making friends now Im into throwing slugs
Olivia talking about we family , Game had to go
Nigga Ill smack that ho like Im Jackie-O
Cause dont wanna be cool , dont wanna be you
dont wanna shake hands , or wear your G-Unit shoes
Dont want you on my hooks , dont wanna be in your group
Just wanna sit here and wait
To be gone , so can head back to the block
Fresh white Nike Airs and the matching Sox fitted
Pull the brim low , if they dont get it
Bentley Coup on gold Daytons , was the first one with it
Four times platinum , done been there and did it
Came in the game and shitted , then wiped my ass with it
They say the Lord givth , if Lord take it away
So build house on top of Hip-Hop , Ill wait for the day
Niggas hating on me , they dont want Jayceon to play
And the DA waiting on Jayceon to make mistake
So they can put me in the SWAT car and lock me away
Give me odd job in the pen for minimum pay
Let me out so can drive down criminal way
Pushing the rock , nah this aint no subliminal , Jay
The summer too hot , and want the winter to stay
Cause Im cold nigga when put the pen to the page
Similar to them shells going into my gauge
hand em off to Dre , he turned them into granades
And Just Blaze , cause the boy got game
Like close my eyes , and woke up in Roc chain
Now back to reality , my gun and my vest
And if diamonds are forever , then Im Kanye West
Take look at my chest , hundred thou wet Jacob
Whole crew got chains , hundred thou cant break em
And the flow is hot like that wit Satan
And the only thing got spinning is Daytons
The hotter get the more willing to snake em
So soon as the beat drop , watch where take em
Compton Swap meet , to get me some All-Stars
When Game in the house , they callin all cars
Cause they heard about what went on in .
Heard about Hot 97 , my beef with 50
Now tell me do he got conscience ?
think not , cause if he did wouldnt be involved in this nonsense
Wouldnt be in Harlem , wouldnt be at this conference
Id rather be pushing rock , like Samantha Ronson
50 whispered in my ear , like we still bonding
We aint friends , Im just acting like Charles Bronson
Middle finger in the air , one hand on my Johnson
Hip-Hop police on me like Im the convict
What happened to the old school ? thought it was rhyming
Doug . Fresh and Dana Dane on the corner like Common
Now that aint common , its more like Top Ramen
The flow is noodles , throw it up like vomit
And still shine like diamonds
They kicked me out of G-Unit and rebounded like Rodman
Its still Aftermath , two feet in the paint
Should be mad , aint , Im supposed to stop , cant , because
Im in the hood politickin , Impala liftin
And keep black . 45 on the side of my Prada denim
Chip on my shoulder like Im fresh outta prison
Dollar vision , blow hundred thou like my wallet missing
Then re-up like Kim before the d-cup
Continuously getting money with my feet up
Chasing the throne , here my black Air Force
said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source
Feel me ? If not then guess you gotta kill me
But you aint gon do that so motherfucker move back
While do . . . and Pac impersonations on two tracks
When wake the dead , everybody remove hats
We miss yall , can get hand clap ?
Now back to rap , why gotta stay strapped ?
On that murder T-I , kill you ASAP
They wont know which hole to patch up , when the clap
tried to spare you Young Buck , now its time for payback
It go , how you from Cashville but you aint got no cash nigga ?
Say my name , now thats your fucking ass nigga
Kept your mouth shut and gave you pass nigga
Now gotta lay you down like the last nigga
Buck , buck , buck from my AK-47
This nigga playing with his life , might have to put him in heaven
Tryna play the game , talking shit up on the stereo
Prepare for burials when Im reincarnating Harry-O
And you dont want that David cause you love your life
Get my Vibe , when its war he pull out butter knifes
Muthafucker Imma show you who the gangsta
All you do is Murder Inc . , now who the wanksta ?
When Suge had you , you were stranded on the row
Juve left you for dead and went back to the NO
50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow
Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo
You bitch , and thats hard to swallow
And you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago
call my nigga Jojo to get it back
He had the shit in his hands , and you aint had the ten stacks
Picture that , thought we was G-Unit
Then you ran and told 50 that did that shit
Ask C-Murder , the boy aint hard to find
told Monica when catch him , the boy is mine
Take one shot of Brandy and pop
Watch his panties drop , when run inside the Candy Shop
Fuck you , 50 , Banks , Yayo , and the cops
And Olivia , mean for man she hot
Now Im running out of breath , like just beatboxed
Got twenty bars to go , lay it down like sheet rock
Dont worry about the flow , the boy know he hot
Hurricanes in store November , nigga fuck Reeboks
Im fly like hummingbird on tree top
The new Hov , the new . . . , the new Pac , need three spots
280 in , aint no getting me back
Im yelling fuck the world , on my victory lap
Remember first it was Buddens , then it was Bleek
Now its whoever motherfucker , yeah , who want beef ?
Now whenever motherfucker , who wanna see me ?
In the coffin , body exhausted , resting in peace
You dont want war nigga , you want peace
So give em the piece , capiche
Let em rest in peace
From West to East the flow is outdatable , irreplacable
Lyrical homicide , hell is hot , Im boxing with Satan
And slipped em the ace , you cannot replace em
If Eazy ever decide to return , remain Jayceon
king in the making , and the throne is for the taking
So climb the mountain top and put my stake in
Got the weight of the world on my shoulder
Not nigga nor hoodrat bitch can stop me from taking it over
This is crack music , go get the baking soda
300 Bars and Runnin , nigga the wait is over

cant feel my face , Im trying to feel the bass
But got all this Ace in my system
Run circles around you rap niggas
Like Im doing drills for the Pistons
Sleep comfy but can still , hear the whispers
Draw steel , cause niggas still dont get the picture
Gotta paint it red just so they can see it
If you cant understand colors , nigga Ice-T it
Now bring the bass back , turn up the sneer
Tell the bitches with lace fronts start fixing they hair
And Mars give nigga drumroll right here
And right there , Yeah . . .
Back , Back , Back up on that rap shit
Keep that Louis napsack and that backpack shit
GTFOH , with that snapback shit
Fucking three bitches night , call it hat trick
Los Angeles , Kings meaning its more than one
Me and Snoop be doing our thing
And kinda did away with the bling
Use to walk around every fucking day with the bling
In and out the fucking safe with the bling
Niggas come around they aint safe with the bling
My shine is mine , catch case for the bling
Out comes the from the waist for the bling
Put this mother fucker in your face for the bling
Burn your tongue now you aint got taste for the bling
80 bars left , whole club sold out
And Imma get this flow out until their aint no fucking car left
Until there aint Cuban cigar left
See my nigga Dre in here , Yeah he on the far left
Long way from car theft , around the corner from homicide
If you seen the shit that seen
You probably be traumatized
Remember when my brother died
Thats what made my mama cry
Spent four years alone then my grandmama died
Damn , aint never been the same
Pay homage to the woman that gave the world to Game
So the drama it will never die
Thats on my mama five
Fuck with my kids or my wifey , thats when the llama fly
Cant afford to lose them
If had to pick between hip hop or my family
Mother fucker , Id choose them
As far as rap niggas , break legs and bruise limbs
Stomp nigga face in , in some huge timbs
Niggas dont invite me to shit , had to move in
Annihilated Bleek , had to tie couple loose ends
Couple crashed cars , had to lose few friends
Wifey want an Escalade , just copped new Benz
Fuck stock , hood niggas ride new rims
Dubs too small fuck it go on 22 then
22 shrinking now we on 24s
Wont be long til 6s sittin on that Porsche
Niggas chopping Maybachs , clever , raw
But Imma chop Chevy , Mad Max the 64
Bitches love it , niggas like that
Hip Hop was high school punch , had to spike that
Tell Bron and Wade the nigga Mike back
If Uncle Otis rubbed you wrong , go get the ice pack
Undisputed beef king , who the fuck could fight that ?
You wanna hit the surplus store , then bring knife back
Niggas goin gold , " shit them is nice plaques "
Finally , get your ass in the ring
Wont fucking fight back
Everybody wants you to swing , go ahead and strike back
Me Im spitting nothing but flames
Im like strike match
Empire Strikes Back , Jedi Mind Tricks
This is how the stars war , why you acting hard for ?

You dont wanna see what the fuck is inside the car door

Put hole in one of you niggas , no par
Rari on the green , got V12 Ferrari on the green

Should of saw me as teen , facin the magazine
Any drama , Im loading up case of the magazines
Not the Source or the XXL know what mean ?
Rolling Stone , aint getting my Vibe
So remain King
At least til . . home
As far as the east , aint no King nigga . . gone
Far as bars that four ocho cinco
So the next line is for Ocho Cinco
Easy on the Clicqot , homie dont drink so
Imma guzzle the bottle and find me fucking sink yo
Where Otis ? Somewhere playing Bingo
Star on my face , Im star like Ringo
Ten bars left , su woo is the lingo
All red everything , no visine though
Just left Boston , no Benzino
Hit something out in New York , Bambino
And coach my team like Pitino
He know , we hit King of Diamonds
Everybody throwing C-Notes
On my way to Sin City , pit stopped in Reno
Feeling like Carlito before they casted Pacino
Matter fact fuck him , De Niro in Casino

Inflicted to roll the trap of the truck on certain day
My haters know they love me just need me to lead their way

Hopped in bought that , holding money like bouquet
But hey no hope my real niggas gotta get it
Talking about the way we fuck them bitches and purps
Pick em up by the fourses and then we get to the nude
Repping this money hard all the way from the first
All my niggas is real to the game and staying true

Shared the same shoes even shared the same Glock
Saving greens even played for the same team

All my day ones , thats who fuck with
Aint no changing me

Still thug with the same niggas that thug with

Throwing up the hood , rolling up that good
Never slipping even though thought they wish would
Got couple homies and all of them different poppin
Held the bottles in the club , but leave all of them spending comfortably
For rolling up that game , smoking till faint
Smiling at you haters while Im laughing to the bank
And the shit got on you cant afford this
Lets get it clear every year make the Forbes list
It dont make dollars dont appear is gonna make more sense
Jump in my cars its like " yeearrhh " when Im going in it
In this game was born in it

So came up had to switch the game up
Told you when was young nigga hustle get the change up
Now everywhere go they throw my gang up
Everybody blog everybody Taylord

Riding through the jungles in that muthafuckin elephant

Swimming through the hood like it got fins on it ( Tell em ! )

grew up on the crime side , the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had secondhands , Moms bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
young youth rocking the gold tooth , Lo goose
Only way begin to off was drug loot
And lets start it like this son , rolling with this one and that one
Pulling out Gats for fun
But it was just dream for the teen who was fiend
Started smoking woolies at 16
And running up in gates , and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question would flow off and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better , same damn Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out went the wrong route
So got with sick-ass clique and went all out
Catching keys from across seas
Rolling in MPVs every week we made forty Gs
Yo nigga respect mine or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick POW , move from the gate now

Cash rules everything around me :
CREAM , get the money
Dollar , dollar bill yall

Its been twenty-two long hard years of still struggling
Survival got me bugging , but Im alive on arrival
peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep
man with dream with plans to make cream
Which failed ; went to jail at the age of fifteen
young buck selling drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get clutch at what could not touch
The court played me short , now face incarceration
Pacin going upstates my destination
Handcuffed in the back of bus , forty of us
Life as shorty shouldnt be so rough
But as the world turns learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from cell
Every day escape from Jakes giving chase , selling base
Smoking bones in the staircase
Though dont know why chose to smoke sess
guess thats the time when Im not depressed
But Im still depressed and ask whats it worth ?
Ready to give up so seek the old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids , corrupt cops , and crack rocks and
Stray shots , all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while be living proof
To kick the truth to the young Black youth
But shortys running wild , smoking sess , drinking beer
And aint trying to hear what Im kicking in his ear
Neglected for now , but yo , it gots to be accepted
That what ? That life is hectic

Niggas got to do what they got to do
To get through know what Im saying ?
Because you cant just get by no more word up
You gotta get over straight up and down

game of chess is like swordfight ;
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong and immune to nearly any weapon ;
When its properly used its almost invincible

Raw Imma give it to ya , with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MCs approach with slang thats dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
Im pushing force , my force youre doubting
Im making devils cower to the Caucus Mountains

Well Im sire , set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary , and carry like Mariah
come from the Shaolin slum , and the isle Im from
Is coming through with nuff niggas , and nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweating , stressing contesting
Youll catch sharp sword to the midsection
Dont talk the talk , if you cant walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
Im mad vexed , its what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain theres no way to barricade me
Steamrolling niggas like eighteen wheeler
With drunk driver driving , theres no surviving

Rough like Timberland wear , yeah
Me and the Clan in Yota Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks , all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads , braids , blow this hook
We pack chrome Tecs , nickel plated Macs
Black Acs , drug dealing styles in phat stacks
only been good nigga for minute though
Cuz got to get my props , and win it yo
got beef wit commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lamping in Lexus eating beef
Straight up and down dont even bother
got forty niggas up in here now , who kill niggas fathers

My peoples are you with me where you at ?
In the front , in the back killa-bees on attack
My peoples are you with me where you at ?
Smoking meth hitting cats on the block with the gats

Here go , deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
Im cherry bombing shits . . . BOOM
Just warming up little bit , vroom vroom
Rappining is whats happening
Keep the pockets stacked and then , hands clap and then
At the party when move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody !
Grab the microphone put strength to the bone
DUH DUH DUH . . . enter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when rock that stuff
Huff ? Puff ? Im gonna catch your bluff tuff
Rough , kicking rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley Im Mi . . Beetle Bailey rhymes
Coming raw style , hardcore
Niggas be coming to the hip-hop store
Coming to buy grocery from me
Trying to be hip-hop MC
The law , in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA , Abbot , RZA , Shaquan , Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ol getting low wit his flow
Introducing , the Ghost . . face . . Killah ! !
No one could get iller


Speaking of the devil psych , no its the God , get the shit right
Mega trife , and yo killed you in past life
On the mic while you was kicking that fast shit
You reneged tried again , and got blasted
Half mastered ass style mad ruff task
When struck had on Timbs and black mask
Remember that shit ? know you dont remember jack
That night yo was hitting like spiked bat
And then you thought was bugged out , and crazy
Strapped for nonsense , after me became lazy
Yo , nobody budge while shot slugs
Never shot thugs , Im running with thugs that flood mugs
So grab your plus , start flipping and tripping
Niggas is jetting Im licking off son

Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang !

Homicides illegal and death is the penalty
What justifies the homicide , when he dies
In his own iniquity its the
Master of the Mantis Rapture coming at ya
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of Master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like terrorist hard to capture
The flow , changes like chameleon
Plays like friend , and stabs you like dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like lie paralyzing the victim
You scream , as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Moving on nigga with the speed of centipede
And injure any motherfucking contender !

Caller : " So whassup man ? "
DJ : " Coolin man "
: " Chillin chilin ? Yo , you know had to call , you why right ? "

smoke on the mic like smokin Joe Frazier
The hell-raiser , raising hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman
So uhh , tick tock and keep ticking
While get you flipping off the shit that Im kicking
The Lone Ranger
Code red : DANGER
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal
Too hot to handle
You battle , youre sayin goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck , Inspectah Decks on the set
The rebel , make more noise than heavy metal

The way make the crowd go wild
Sit back relax , wont smile
Rae got it going on pal , call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And Ima get mad deep like threat
Blow up your project
Then take all your assets
Cause came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip , go flip on the next man
Cause grab the clip and
Hit you with 16 shots and more , got
Going to war with the melting pot hot

Its the Method Man , for short Mr . Meth
Movin on your left
And set it off , get it off , let it off like Gat
wanna break fool , cock me back
Small change , they puttin shame in the game
take aim and blow the nigga out the frame
And like Fame my style will live forever
Niggas crossin over but they dont know no better
But do
True , can get " suuue "
Nuff respect due to the one-six oooo

Yo , check out the flow
Like the Hudson or PCP when Im dustin

The smoke from the lyrical blunt makes me * cough *

Ooh what
Grab my nut , get screwed
Oww , here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A ba-B Y-U
To my crew with " suuue "

Cmon baby , baby cmon baby , baby cmon baby baby cmon

Yo , you best protect ya neck

First things first man , youre fuckin with the worst
Ill be stickin pins in your head like fuckin nurse
Ill attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And Ill be damned if let any man
Come to my center
You enter the winter
Straight up and down , that shit is packed : jam
You cant slam , dont let me get fool on him , man
The Ol Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinking
Ason Unique rollin with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin with stash , aint sayin cash
Bite my style Ill bite your motherfuckin ass

For crying out loud , my style is wild , so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Heres more again
Catch it like psycho flashback
love Gats
If rap was gun , you wouldnt bust back
come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where lounge is my stompin grounds
give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like shooting star
Cause who are is living the life of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as kick the square biz
There it is , youre fuckin with pros and there it goes

Yo chill with the feedback , black , we dont need that
Its 10 oclock , ho , where the fucks your seed at
Feelin mad hostile
Flowin like Christ when speaks The Gospel
Stroll with the Holy robe
Then attack the globe
With the buck-us style : the ruckus
Ten times ten men committing mad sin
Turn the other cheek and Ill break your fuckin chin
Slang boom-bangs like African drums
( Hell be ) coming around the mountain when cum
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah , another one down , G-g genius
Take us the fuck outta here

The Wu is too slammin for these Cold Killin labels
Some aint had hits since seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they moneys gettin stuck to the gum under the table
Thats what you get when you misuse what invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as 20-watt light bulb
Shouldve pumped it when rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors
Theyre scared to death to pump these
First of all , whos your &
mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he dont know the meanin of dope
When hes lookin for suit-and tie rap thats cleaner than bar of soap
And Im the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact , bring out the girls and lets have mud fight

You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
What yall thought yall wasnt gonna see me
Im the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever , motherfuckers
This ninety-seven
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Lets do it like this
Ima rub your ass in the moonshine
Lets take it back to seventy-nine

bomb atomically
Socrates philosophies and hypotheses
Cant define how be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery , possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun , explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous , ultra-violet shine blind forensics
inspect you , through the future see millennium
Killer Bees sold fifty gold , sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen Bs ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen , tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite war
Chicks hit the floor , die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier , control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow , swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked , performing live on your hottest block

As the world turns , spread like germs
Bless the globe with the pestilence
The hard-headed never learn
Its my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
Transform into the Ghost Rider
six-pack and streetcar named desire
Who got my back in the line of fire holding back what
My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at
Niggas is strapped and they trying to twist my beer cap
Is court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like bad perm , what the blood
Clot , we smoke pot and blow spots
You want to think twice , think not
The Iron Lung aint got to tell you where its coming from
Guns of Navarone , tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

twist darts from the heart , tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP , martini on the slang rocks
Certified chatterbox , vocabulary Donna talking
Tell your story walking
Take cover kid what
Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your " six cant rhyme " groupies
So can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reigns supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect , arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take free ride on my thought got the fashion
Catalogs for all yall to all praise due to God

The saga continues
Wu-Tang , Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming , we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory , the agony defeat
We crush slow , flaming deluxe slow
For judgment day cometh , conquer its war
Allow us to escape , hell glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky , Golden Arms
Tunes split the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fateful step make , the blood stain the ground
jungle junkie , vigilante tantrum
death kiss , catwalk , squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom , tranquilized with anesthesias
My orchestra , graceful , music ballerinas
My music Sicily , rich California smell
The axe kill adventure , paint picture well
sing song from Sing-Sing , sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperone , rotating ring kings

March of the wooden soldiers
C-Cypher Punks couldnt hold us
thousand men rushing in , not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square we stamp gold like Fleer
Escape from your dragons lair in particular
My beats travel like vortex through your spine
To the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Now terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat basslines on Novation
Getting drunk like fuck , Im ducking five-year probation

War of the masses , the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim family save they ashes
million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray , niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds thats heard
Ninety-three million miles away from came one
To represent the Nation , this is gathering
Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle , the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel-I Reef takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Yo Yo Yo , fuck that , look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Pumas on my mans rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had Navy green salamander fiend , bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces , scum of the slum , got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in eighty-one
Sound convincing , thousand dollar cord by convention
Hands like Sonny Liston , get fly permission
Hold the fuck up , Ill unfasten your wig , bad luck
humiliate , separate the English from the Dutch
Its me , black , Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese , is that so
Caesar needs the greens , its Earth
Ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence , the wave burst , split the megahertz

Aiyyo thats amazing , gun in your mouth talk , verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer , Wu-Tang , all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor world tranquilizer
Just dosage , delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean , see yall , the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God , then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor , flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel , play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly , undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made em jump like Rod Strickland
[ Meth ] Yeahhh , torture motherfucker what ? [ Torture nigga what ? ] What ?

With starwriters like fucked Celine Dion

Official Wu-Tang headbanger
Flood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka

Yo , drink heavy gallons of Crew , play the big part
Niggas got squid on the grill , selling kids Clarks

Yellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun

Solid tone smith with 6th shots , lick shots

Its the return of Bin Laden , grab your armor
Smash pretty boy niggas , crush they karma
Eat bones with alligators , roll deep , with my entourage
My whole crews fresh out the bars
Diggler , AKA the Cab Driver
Drop him off in the middle of fire
Dirty Island , drag bodies to the Murderland
Knock niggas out hurtin my hand

remember in the elevators when we was playin corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin on us , ( uh )
Statens where the war is
Where the court systems running out of warrants
Where TNT be jumping out the Taurus
For real cant call it
You see love Lucy cuz she lawless
Exactly like that 1-0 3-0 is
Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island Im from
And yall dont want no problems with them

We got history , full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough it aint no mystery
Long vision , from giants in every way
Rap czars , magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the ville , from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes , encouraging skills
From rat packs , the smallest crews were enormous
We hit em fast , with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those thats more sensitive to heat and shock

We grindin , down to the bone
My name grounded in stone
Im Mr . Violence we loungin with Chrome
Mr . Violence we lounge in his home , hit the housing on Rome
Shining like hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems , got jones for dinero
1-6 zero my songs we throwin elbows
The hoes cling , sho thing , we know kings
Only dime dikes , with minds right , we choose Queens

Yeah we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast , he aint ghost
Its no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke
One toke brains float , shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit , witness the killing
On the crime scene
Body on the block
Eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still had lit cigarette between his fingers
Danger when you step into the chamber with the master
Disaster , gotta blast ya , cuz hafta

The rat pack is back from the island of Stat
Leave you cursed off , cuz you worship the gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncers head off , let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed , to the turntables like , Wizard Theodore
See its pure , let it rain curly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You dont want no drama , Im flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash
Yo , this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
For all my peoples incarcerated , for those who aint make it

Yo , in the housing , thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways , memories stays engraved
All my live brothers , is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger , blind to these lies , they die younger
In this New World the Order slaughter men , women , and children
Ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
The projects , lifeless like vietnam vet
Constant war , sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex thats in the rumble
Streets are like jungle , cant let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts , Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage , lust for chicks and quick dollars
know the pain the game bring , did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase , performing sting
Its hard to keep control , bless those who seek scroll
Trying to reach whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not role model , walk hard road to follow
sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told , some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold , and they eventually sold
Their life and times , deadly like the virus design
But too , minute to dilute , the scientist mind

You cant party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way

voice cries from the wilderness of the North
representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads
To skin irritations , babies being born with
Disfigurations , experimentations
On their faces there bear worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain screams of terror
Are hidden by the passing trains
This cant be little Hussein , his uncle cried
As he drops to his nephews side , holding his cane
Just give me name , of who has inflicted this
Bitter sickness , and left us to witness

Yeah , yo
Curses from war , innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways , hands , solemn in praise
Tree of life , more precious than Wu is golden game
The wise self flourish inherit , Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me , locked in prison
While we die hard living people whine about religion , vision
Blow , spin , and sin and killing whats revealing
Its never ending battle with no ending or beginning , listen
Zero process , progress , become the hunted
Americas most wanted , good life flaunted , want it
Some love the speed , some satisfy need
Some want to be down , young gun seed , jungle breed
The strong must feed , someone die , someone bleed
One flew astray , and it caught my little seed
Can it be , the ice have us trife life , made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes , pipes
Take in my energy , breath and know the rest
Cause the good die young and the hard die best

You cant party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way

Yall bitches love dances , and pulling down your pants
While your mans on tour , your spending up his advances
Your friends aint shit , all they do is drink , smoke , and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in stench
You either high school drop-outs , one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old , shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking
Fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
New World Order slave trade , minimum wage , Medicaid
Can devil fool Muslim nowadays
Inside my lab , Im going mad
Took two drags off the blunts , and started breaking down the flag
The blue is for the Crips , the red is for the Bloods
The whites for the cops , and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites , through the night , by the dawn
Early light , why is sons fighting for the stripe

As we dwell through this concrete hell , calling it home
Mama say , take your time young man and build your own
Dont wind up like your old dad
Still searching for them glory days he never had
So many bad want to scheme for American dream , no more kings
The cash rule everything now , we going down
These babies looking up to us , its up to us
The Million Man March MCs , get on the bus
But envy , greed , lust , and hate , separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer , brothers , we unstable
Like Kane when he slew Abel , killing each other

You cant party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way

On that AIDS thing
YouknowhatImsayin ? Im gonna just slide in the studio quick and get this done
Yo , yo

When youre sexually frustrated , plus waiting for long time
You both had strong minds
Combined with feelings , she seems appealing , for each other
Discreet lover , no longer keeps rubbers
Smothered under deep covers
Erotic programs , Moet and slow jams
Enough to make you hold hands and plus you bold man
You fall in manhole , where the forbidden tree grow
And bullshit ego , of fly negro
Her garden sour , polluted with dead flower
Months later , hes layin on respirator
Depending on generator , to keep his heart moving
And start losing sight in his right eye
In weeks he might die

know this dope-fiend cat , word up , his name is Javier
Part-time shooter sharing needles in the stairs
Wise guys disguised as fly guy
You getting high right ? Weeded up with red shit in your right eye
Yous menace , your brain cells finished
Begging forgiveness , calling that up top shit syphillis
You know what you was gettin into
Try to guess on what Ive been through
Fuck shorty raw then she scared you

Coming from the Wu , its real
AIDS kills , word up respect this , yo

My nigga Chuck , he loved to fuck
Everything exotic bitches down to ugly ducks
Like Nancy , who liked the fancy tickles
So he put popsicles on her nipples to make her sex passion
Triple quadriple
Until she bust
Overcome with passion , big ass want lust upon him
But nigga he forsake to grab the condom
Fuck it , he said AIDS , was government made
To keep niggas afraid so they wont get laid no babies be made
And the black population will decrease within decade
German warfare product against the dark shade

AIDS kills , word up respect this , yo
Coming from my crew , its real
AIDS kills , word up respect this , yo
Coming from the Wu , its real

Caught by the gravitation earth rotation
Six in the sex is deep , when you cant see clear
Through the sheer brassiere , toke back
Smoking spliff , sippin cognac , God
You know my two love songs , Bobby Womack tracks
Got her fat ass layin flat on her back

Yo , as she lay , she wore silk gray neglige
Alize pours , the radio play , Marvin Gaye
Whats Going On ? As she screams Sexual Healing
Couldnt fight the feeling her legs hit the ceiling
Hittin all positions dipped in for quick love
Shes professional she does this shit in strip clubs
Flied in June until she Acquired Immune Deficiency
Now misery is the Syndrome

Oh shit , God thats wild
Damn , thats some cherry flavor shit going on though kid
For real , knowhatImsayin ?

Caskets is waitin for brothers

Dirty Bas , style cuts like glass

Yo Gods , another-like platinum hit
Party people all around be sayin thats the shit

Kaboom , guess who stepped in the room
Tical , hailing from the Shaolin Isle
It be me the killer bee , on the M-I
With the S-S double-double to the V-V
Me me going downtown , let me see
If we all and together now , make it mo better now
Listen aint sweating no competition
Flow , going mad low like Im dissing

Another chapter from the Wu-Tang group
Take look or peak , killer bees never sleep
Nonstop put you on the chopping block
Unorthodox , attitude to melting pot

Ill do anything , Im so into you
Right here , Im Weak , downtown with the Wu
Kaboom , guess who stepped in the room
The S-S double-double to the V-V

Intro / Chorus : Ol Dirty / Osirus

As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you cant wear it , well dont fuck with it !

Verse One : The Genius / GZA

Yo , too many songs , weak rhymes thats mad long
Make it brief Son , half short and twice strong
No doubt , it took time searchin , eventually
It was prime urgent , for you to examine the rhyme merchant
Lace MCs with styles when they rhyme drunk
On label hunt , until twenty thou , out the trunk
Eight Diagram sword swinga armored tank force
RZA throw in the disc but then change the bank source
You cant flow , must be the speech impediment
You got lost off the snare off Impeach the President
Whether in Amsterdam smokin seven grams of green
Then you pack , thousand white teens in tight jeans
This Witty Unpredictable shot is critical
To analytical analogy , insurance policies why
Said he know that sounds define the note
Couldnt recognize , blast him the fuck behind the ropes
Too many dope niggas see starvin
Catch single deal , possible plea bargain
Wu slay regardles to whom or what , five mics five nights
Hang him from the balcony , drop twenty-five flights
fugitive bass playin rap czar
Smoke the cigars , his prints on the strings of his guitar

Chorus

Verse Two : Method Man / Iron Lung

Tical got hold on ya , doin exactly
What the fuck mariju-wanta , dis nigga nasty
Deep in the dirty dungeon , buggin , lovin
The ways these rhymes keep comin , at cha splash ya
Get your head piece fractured , with killer cuts
From the Shropshire Slasher , rip shit up
Got this whole thing Tang mastered , sho nuff
An MC too good to be touched , John John
Bring the phenomenon , cold crush
MC , inferiorities they froze up , ice cold
As we move on , saga unfold
Captivated by saga that go untold , like Goldfinger
Caught up in cliffhanger
Yo I-N another code red , danger , break out the vest
Now its tactical warfare , its all here
Come with your shield and hardware , it be on here
Dont ever roam , in the naked city
Eight million stories none pretty
Bomb em wit the Witty Unpredictable , conditionin be critical
Peace to Tang , gettin high on your physical , dis next drink
Is toast to your memory
When go how many niggas gon remember me

Chorus
The RZA , the GZA , Ol Dirty Bastard , Inspectah Deck
Raekwon the Chef , U-God , Ghostface Killah , Masta Killa
And the Me yeah , yeah , come on , now , now

Whats happening ? Who get it cracking like neck snapping
For the rapping , and who them fellas packing yelling Staten
From the background , Ill back down few
Try to clown us in the past , where they at now ?
Im ill as baby powder with the smackdown , for the record
My brain is like the project projected , for the Method
Go see my nigga Kush , he got the best shit for burning
This one go out for whom it may concerning
Spending they entire earning , trynna get higher learning
MCs is vermin , like be Sermon
Yall too determined , feeling yaself like Pee-Wee Herman
While we at it , lets tighten up our grips around that cabbage
Silly rabbits , how many kidsll trick you out your carrots
Ghetto bastards and ghetto bitches , break you like bad habit
My dick is two inches too big for its britches
Uh , so fuck mister and your misses
Cottonmouth niggas Xed out like Merry Christmas , that all
Uh-huh , be home

* bell rings *

Knock , knock , who is it , Tical pop digit
My block too hot to visit , round here , you gots to live it
MCs , you must admit it , Im deadly on this mic like
Anthrax on this premise , anyone of yall can get in
breathe , Backwoods sleeves and THC
bleed , kamikazes and forty OZs
Americas Most , the better the smoke , the better the quotes
For cheddar , Methll sever the throat , whatever the coast
Im home , let the sun shine on , get his grind on
And get some phone time , everytime Im in your timezone
Look here , its crooked letter , yall dont meet nothing but crooks here
Its hot in hells kitchen , get your cookware , for goodness
MCs is like that shit chicks be gushing
For pushing , got me tooken down to Central Booking
stick out , as if Tical just walked up in the party with my dick out
And Im prepared to take the shit dish out

" When you realize that what you got aint what you want " sample

On the , yo , on the expressway , suddenly , , um , hit the breaks
mistake , patrol figure just , ran the plates
pull to the shoulder , half mile ahead
The vibe got colder when the marksman said
" Yo , you in the truck , get the fuck out your car
Put your hands where my eyes could see , not far "
fat slob , with pepperspray in the canister
Donut shop lounger , nine mil brandisher
Plus my half pound just rang the bell
Of the bloodhound , had an acute sense of smell
guess he was tired of the strip and booking whores
Moving off tip hes claimed hes looking for
Some MCs wanted for string of break-ins
Last seen wearing long minks and snakeskins
Light is shinin . . beauty sunshine
Here comes one-time . . the ball was so fine
Heat is blazin . . the kids were playin
His partner was shady . . tryin to slave the babies

Aiyyo they didnt know the cop was crooked , he had blow out in Brooklyn
All this while he let the fiends cook it
The baseheads stirred it up , plus they got to blow it up
Dropped it off in the PJs and they bigged it up
Then one day , shit jumped off real crazy
The middle of bathroom they find an old lady
No clothes , half of her tongue , ear missin
The killer had to be mad smart , he wore mittens
Even though her leg was bitten
Crackheads point the finger at Detective Slick Morris Gittins
Paleface cop who done popped the best
And got the chop on his neck from when he knocked Celeste
It was slug , drug , he pressured everybody on the block
Some niggas know him as the Godson of Gotti
And his black partner , he was scared to speak
He saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street
He saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks
He saw his colleague pick up money before leavin his beat
They call him desk duty , Robocop
Younger dudes call him Freddy Krugs from the way he walk on the block


Heard the disturbance out the window , oh shit they got my son
Pulled over his Tempo , Brenda dropped the endo
Had her little nephew with her yo she didnt care
They always harassed her , until she blew the captain with razor
His partner turned red in his waist , Mase done smacked her
With the walkie , yoked her then slammed her on her face
He bugged on her like she was drugged , plugged one in her
The fifth relaxed her like big thug pistol whipped her
Heard she was dusted , musta been the way they threw the cuffs on her
She broke the shits , went and rushed the kid
Wavin her hands , she had half an axe , all in her tracks
He grabbed her by the air , she broke his jaw it cracked
More cops arrived , they both bloodied down by the five
Wildest niggas just smilin cause it look live
They gave her forty years in New Orleans , callin me wodie
Shorty was young , by three days had great bid


Youre just worms in the worst part of the apple thats rotten
You squirm and you turn from the right , still plottin
All slimy cause you stay grimy , petty crimey cat
You sometime me , dont need to remind me about
Livin in the core , with the scramblers in front of the store
The bum holdin the door , the mugging no one saw
We played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw
And the school they kept flawed , plus the lowest test scores
Small percentage determined to strengthen they position
Transformation from critical to , stable condition
But it still be obstacles on niggas thats optical
Watchin you like salt-water sharks thats tropical
The money was the root and its the instinct to make it
With they pockets and fridge naked , many aim to take it
Whether hold up , set up , stabbin or wet up
Just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up
Once he fell short , frequently visit the courts
And for some , another way out , is music and sports
Thats why , keep the rhyme just as fly as shot
That won the championship , with just oh on the clock

[ Hook ] repeat 2X
" Its true the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang , could be dangerous ! "

Uh-huh , Mr . Biggs , Trackmasters ( woo ! )
Its Wu-Tang official right here yknow

Yeah , the employees of the year yeah were back to work
We took time off , while other rappers got jerked
Shits bout to change now , its shame how
Things aint the same but Im back in the game now
And as we step in the door , we cause panic
Yep , the usual suspects , we at it
Vet status , yall went week with the belt
Few chicks felt your style , now you feelin yourself
Meet your maker , dropped you at eight years old
got stock in your flow and crops to sharehold
Crops with the prose where cops wont dare go
Got top centerfolds too hot to wear clothes
Still me always have and will be
Ill its silly to hate but feel free
Hey hear what say , they gotta pay
And my return is like Christ , declare the holiday

Back in the game now . . copped me some weed now
My people bout to eat now . . shits bout to change now
Back in the game now . . all my niggas in the hood now
Better catch up now . . shits bout to change now

Uh , yall see Im in the street strugglin
Young dumb and thuggin , give FUCK about nuttin
Stuck at rock bottom , tryin to come up on somethin
Pumpin from sundown to sun-up , we hustlin
Vision my nigga now get in where you fit in
And see prison , as just the high cost of livin the life
Ante up cause if you blow the dice
On that O-Z , Dorothy aint goin home tonight
Thats on erythang , put it on the kids and the wife
Been buryin my folks ever since they raised the price on the coke
Searchin for quick antidote
Mo money , mo problems to cope

We were at the same table when the chips were checked
gamblin + Rebel + who + Inspects + the + Deck +
Just when you thought we would fold our hand
Against all odds we raised the bet like we changed the plans
It was live on air but in between station breaks
was holdin pair and just made the table stakes
Split the demos , put insurance on tapes
safeguard against the crusaders in capes
If double down they say the Gods are sharks
If we win against the house they thought the cards was marked
We draw hit after hit from royal flush menu
While the dealer promoted the full house venue
spade in the club with the heart to wear diamonds
The high roller who got credit upon signin
They look puzzled when shuffle , most of em stunned by the hustle
Recourse of bluff games your muscle

[ Hook ] . 75X
[ Raekwon ] Say what ? ( " Shaolin shadowboxing ! " )
[ . Isley ] Shits bout to change . .

Aiyyo , on rainy days sit back and count ways on
How to get rich , coolin with mean ill Jamaican bitch
Banana coat matchin with the ratchet
Lil black weave sweatpants style , air force is actin
Jump in the , kicks look crisp , talkin bout the bird
Flow through your hood in the mean tints thats giant
Its like the family that flipped on you for lyin
Buried you alive , left your whore cryin
We on your floor look more doors
Dey aint ate either , hope yall niggas is armed
And when we get there , all my niggas in the mix
Yeah Shallah Lex , Diamond got me buyin Louis Rich wear

Most people say the Clan was missin since got dropped offa radio
Overnight your whole style was bitten in the process
Everybody switched they names like
Whatcha call it , any fast ( ? )
It was the Gods that repped that , sharkskin dark skinned bitches
Clarks from Digi left the game dizzy
Ooh got busy , that dancey shit slid through
We had to stay hood cause thats who we been through
RZA came through , mastermind got the cash and power
Proof that power plastered divine classical lines
Mathematical rhymes , the style is unbearable
Now niggas with the radical shines
Its Ghost-Deini , every coast need me
We back motherfucker thats right , its the . .
World Trade Center , Wu-Tang Clan
We brought so much heat that we was givin you tans an shit


{ * Ron Isley ad libs to fade * }
Give me the cue

Skip the introduction proceed to lip function
The junction get rushed by some grimy people busting weed
Splatter your melon like some Attica felons
Use firearm good , Bloods go for heart swelling
Insert the spasm , yes the dirty herb has him
Thoroughbred thugs insert the fantasm
Verbal smarts , spark the word , visit my scripture
Exotic wine , holding nine Picasso pictures
When the rhyme pivot you now , limit your chance
Bodyguard the lyric with unlimited stance
Words seem to zing on down to Beijing
When we touch down , would you crown renowned kings

Theres no honor amongst thieves
Street pharmaceutical stack like Genovese
The Four Devils tempt madmen but not these
We profound hardcore sound to MCs , thumbs down , prepare
Killa bees it be warfare , this the year
Niggas gotta take you off of here , hold the square
If we go there we go gritty and spread fear
Through this rap city , call the mayor
My razor sharp darts be like cold stares
The smell of fear make my nostrils flair , truth or dare ?
Ask yourself can you compare to these niggas in the hood
Johnny . Goode or he be gone yeah
The struggle goes on , youve been warned
PLO from here to Lebanon , how many bomb
Must we drop in the Ninety-Now ?
Walk mile in my shoes , get the street news from Meth-Tical

Glocksll be spitting , you gots to be kidding
Aiyo kid you gots to be kidding
Or Glocksll be spitting
You gots to be kidding yo

Its common sense how master my circumference , you dense
get locked the fuck up , released on my own recognizance
Cant be judged , young bloods bust back like scuds
Wu-Tang hovers one thousand notches above
MC level , yo , stay highs like treble
Foes who oppose get plucked like rose petals
Arresting and holding , penetrate forbidden regions
Wack MCs only lasting one season
The morale was low at the corral
Adjective pronouns had no style , your weak proposal
Aim for the official , initial is Ruler Zig-Zag Zig Allah
All that other bullshit aint permissible
Annual increase of the Wu-Tang Manual
Handles to keep all this Hip Hop shit tangible
Illegible , every egg aint edible
My tracks remain Unforgettable like Ol Nat Cole
Got to catch this paper to buy Shaquasia glacier
Nebuchadnezzar skyscraper
Understanding the continents of Africa and Asia
And free the Black Man from enslaved labor , Wu-Tang

The weight of the fam is on our back and we cant fall
Victim to this long hall of fame , meaning nothing
We came to punish the glutton with substance
That cant be contained , Wu-Tang

Motherfuckers
We be seeing yall asses when we walk up in the club
Yall all in the back
Scared to speak , we speak cause you scared
Punk motherfucker , we know what time it is

All you been seeing is upsets in the boxing shit , right
Its like come on man
This nigga fucked up motherfucking Whitaker
Dang , he caught Whitaker
He caught Whitaker long time ago
Mike got touched
Then Mike got touched by Holyfield
Hey Mikes , Mikes gonna forfeit this fight
He aint fighting McDermit
He aint fighting

Fix your sawed off , Wu-Tang tore me off the cross

The Betty Crocker Marvel cake , snakes will miss
Wax janitor , black Jack Mulligan from Canada
Slam dance , tarantula style , yous fan of the
Monopoly king , Slavic poetry
Carnegie Halls off the hook , lets push through the armory
Mack truck hitting soloist , Soul Controllers

Stress reliever soak your feet , air them out
Brain message , think about pink
Stress relieving , no dishes in the sink
Upper lower , left , right , neck dont play
Back rub , Calgon , take me away
Waterfall beads , streams , plush and lavish
Comfort me through all the damn madness
Night breeze at sea , sipping tea
You and your queen melodies , and trees , 85 degrees
Jet skis breeze . . .
Sprinkle water on chocolate , butter scotch flowers
Vapor action , tropical sunshower
Baby powder , relax , feel for an hour
Sand suntan , snuggled up snug
Snowey days , fireplace , oriental rug
Thugs , lay on the couch , pull it out , perfect balance
Chemical stimuli , two tokes off the chalace
Complete silence , what surround us
Whats the finest , wrapped in cold sheets
Vanilla apple heat , flutes play jazz music , puffy pillow suites
Breakfast in bed , early morning sun treats
Sunset level , suprise sunrise , sail
Lay on the couch , while clip your toenails
Dreams of peaches and cream steam secret spells
Soft spoken gospel , Barry White acapell
Violin , good medicine , sound swell
Sunshine life , love right without the hell
Taste sugar , quiet storm , seasick
Slowdance drink , like nights over Egypt
Having , stabbing , calm chilling now we rolling
Company , ice cream licking now we holding
Gentle force , warm tingle of the golden
Open loose , ice cubes , kiss your belly
Alcohol , palm trees , peanut butter jelly
Almond twirl , fantastic melodies
Soon , taste these spoons
Wiping me with toon , fly wine , quiet storm
Now its high noon , raspberry spices
Cherry breath , drink from the mountain , sip the very best
Sounds of the shore , every winter is war
Paradise life , recipe now pour
Musicness , model , gentle mental
Wash away your sorrow , Fantasy Island
Put the message in the bottle
Carry you through , the threshold , do my duty
Happy ending , go to rest Sleeping Beauty
Yo , this is that body shop shit
Love love slam
Edible underwear , champagne , bubble bath
Have your snack on that ass that
Know what mean ?
Massaging these melodies
Put that gangsta shit on the shelf
Blow winds , blow , through your hair
Sea breeze sticks and shit

Billy Danze : Representing , dangerously
Cousin , you know the drill
Lil Fame : Respect mine we Brooklyn bound , bound !

Playing my position , hot Nixon
This one , for all the sick ones , confliction
Posionous darts sickening , best believe
Finger itching with two broke legs , now Im tripping
On MCs cliche , shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles , hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me , G-O no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly , tap your jaw
From my punch , watch your son and you
Got you shitting in your last Huggie , running who ?
Fucking punk , get speed bump coming through
single shot make your knees knock , respect Wu

Aiyyo put it on nigga , shit it on nigga
Turnin Christian to certified sinner
The bomb release , time pent up ( explodes )
While you got set up was hittin your ex ho
Shit kept low , petro your metro
Politic , keep the chickenheads bobbing
Shit Im driving in , come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city , from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty , smack the drivers head in the chin see
When approach rappers be taking notes
drop like shouldve invented the raincoat
Absolute , love to burn to the roots

( Chorus )

Todays agenda
Got the suitcase up in the Sentra
Go to room 112 , tell em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest
If no money exchanges
got these kids in ranges
Believe them niggas brainless
All they tote is stainless
You just remain as
Calm as possible , make the deal go thru
If not , heres 12 shots , we know how you do
Please make yo killings clean
Slugs up in between
They eyes , like True Lies
Kill em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else , yo life is on the shelf
We mean this Frank
Them cats we fucking wit put bombs in yo moms gas tank
Lets get this money baby
They shady , we get shady
Dress up like ladies
And burn em with dirty 380s
Then they come to kill our babies

We up in the lab , two Spanish , one Arab lady
Laying on the bed , looking like drag
Had the pillow cuffed , looking at me and Frank , her grill was rough
Who wouldve ever think shed rather do us up
But thats the business , back to the sitch
On these Puerto Rican kids with pistols
Doin sign language is twitching noses
Ask em where the money at , yo where the coke at papi ?
We can do this all day , yo yall both whack
They pulled out , one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out
They snuck up on him , put the tool up in his mouth
Walked them up in crib , big move , but they grabbed the kid
Had the shotty on my beehive , my wig
And yo they took me to the bathroom , started up the chainsaw yo
You gon talk or see your brains on the floor

( Chorus )

Bleed just like us , believe my pipe bust
If he holding the right amount of cheese might rush the spot
Up early in the morning , kick the door in , wave the an
( fuck ) the brawling , cause Tony for the stalling
And all see is $ signs , heres the bottom line either
Give up the product or get shot up with brolic
Invest figures to address ( niggas )
Working out , all curl is my index finger
Got safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers
My work is move trays , serve em up like gourmet dinners
When it comes to cuttin that ( coke ) , who got the best trimmers
Edward Scissorhands them grams , ( niggas ) respect winners
got them big spenders coming through , hourly
Competition , we knock em out the box , powerfully
Still drop ill verse , on the . . , me
You might be gone , but the legacy is . . . , nigga

Its mister word renowned with the best verse
One of the illest the streets , from the east to the west , heard
Get greeted with ghetto gestures like " yessir "
pre-meditated killer for the way stretch words
Some of us love to flow til the club close
And some in love with blow for the love of dough
In it for fortune and fame , flamboyant for girls
They extorting the game , exploiting the hood
Rappers ride for bread while the gossip spread
Its only hot cause we ride , spotted cops with feds
Plus , lots of heads go Pop instead
Thats the word on the block is , " Hip-Hop Is Dead "
So consumers quit copping , rappers flip-flopping
Artist pimped by they labels like slave pick cotton
Pop Charts killing underground Hip-Hopers
While the world still looking for Ra like Bin Laden , lets go

( Chorus )

In God we trust
Yo its must that you heard of us yo we murderous
lot of niggas is wonderin and they curious
Im making my niggas deal with it so mysterious
Furious all of my niggas is serious
Should niggas be walkin around fearing us
Frontin nigga like you dont wanna be hearing us
Gotta listen to the radio be playing us
30 time day shitll make you delirious
Damagin everything all up in your areas
Yo its funny how all the chickens be always serving us
All up in between they ass where they wanna carry us
Hitcha gonna hit em off with the illiest
Varias chickens they wanna marry us
Yo its Flipmode my nigga you know we bout to bust
Settle for your money the label preparing us

Suckers clobber , because my town is full of cops and robbers
Youre not promised tomorrow in this Little Shop of Horrors
So got to get with the business of hit quick
Moneygrips pockets looking thick so stick Slick
Hold it right here , hands in the air , know you got the loot
Or better yet , face down on the ground , empty your pockets troop
Hit the deck got the Tech right on your neck
And expect to make buck to heck with travellers check
But if vic tries to choke me
Ill have to smoke him like Im Smokey the Bear , so okie dokie
Goodbye , or bon voyage , have good journey
Dont even try begging for your life , that dont concern me
So to the next weasel that freezes
Your begging and your pleases only getting your closer to meeting Jesus
Yeah , shake schmuck just to make buck
Then break duck and if the duck gotta get bucked then dont give * *

( Chorus )
Today Ill talk about kindness
Justice , faith , and kindness
want you to listen carefully
Kindness and faith , are the foundation
Without them , we cant become good people
And with justice , we know we can lead good life
And how can be good man then , eh ?
Huh . . . well , first of all , you have to practice honesty
Mmm ?
Keep your temper , never lose control of yourself
Keep control
Be patient , if you learn to do these things , you can master anything

Out of nowhere , there came caravan
This was around campfire light
lovely woman in motion
Her hair was as dark , as the night

Cruisin on the interstate , just follow while innovate
Too many try and imitate , medallion like dinner plate
Front and get your dinner ate , chinchilla for the winter , wait
Im tryin to bring the " Sexy Back " like Timbaland and Timberlake
Spittin like calico , kush from Cali ho
Tell that joker " tally ho " , put shots in that Denali yo
RZA you know how we go on them 20s , thats how we roll
And dont eat berries but eat Berry like Halle though
The game criminal , my , my chain figaro
My , my dames pigeon-toed , Im still the same nigga though
Uh , kid rock fitted low , still got wicked flow
And Im like Barry Bonds on anything that RZA throw

On anything that RZA throw , Ironmans invisible
left my chick for cheatin on me , now that bitch is miserable
Poppin bottles , paintin hella Wallos on my physical
We gon have ball , might as well pick testicle
Purple haze festivals , smoke nigga like bowl
Fuck coma , now the state you layin is vegetable
You wanna see me ? Like you aint checkable ?
You like CD , burn you and wrecked few . . .


Only God , has lept into avenged mind
And can distinguish , good , from evil
Ha ha ha ha

[ RZA ] Aye Yo Cappa ! !

We gotta get more cake together , so we could branch out
Preserve land , get boat and ranch house
Call me dreamer , but hustle for real
You thought that fell off but now Im attackin the field
All in Chicago , grindin , puttin it down
Crush blocks of MCs , aint playin around
Yo you heard me on The Bassment , givin it to em
Fake dudes hidin theyself , but could see through em
Diggler , what ? Im tryin to live and raise kids
While you throwin up ya sign , Im layin em down kid
Plus Im back home now , doin my thing
Thirty dollars to Medina just to cop me ring

Bad company makes bad wine !
Drinking among friends
Red wine means good life

Brilliant , display of genius
Hey you know everybodys talking about the " good old days "

Shooting that " thats that shit ! " in his blood stream
Thats the life of grimey , real-life crimey
And niggas know that habits behind me
Day one , yo , growing all up in the ghetto

In Medina , yo , no doubt the God got crazy clout
Pushing the big joint from down South
So if youre filthy stacked up

Though Im tired of busting off shots , having to rock knots
Running up in spots and making shit hot
Id rather flip shows instead of those
Hanging on my living room wall :
My first joint and it went gold !
want to lamp , want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight , getting my dick rode all night
want to have me phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now its just big dream
Cause find myself in the place where Im last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed , be able to maintain
Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone , and everybodys doing bad
Yo , mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passing away , gotta make wakes
Receiving all types of calls from upstate
Yo , cant cope with the pressure
Settling for lesser
The God left lessons on my dresser
So can bloom and blossom , find new way
To continue to make more hits with Rae and
Sunshine plays major part in the daytime
Peace to mankind , ( Ghostface carry black nine )

Something in the street went BANG BANG . .

Hopped two cabs , back on the Ave
Stab you with the vocab , catch me at the big dough rehab
Tryna re-up , keep my feet up
Snake niggas in the cut , hold the product
Time is up , no luck , heat start to bust
Niggas you cant trust , dealing with lust
Seen him at the ballgames with James

Something in the street went , BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went , BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang

Something in the hall went { Click Click }
The boxcutter went { Click Click }

These are the bones , bones from the grave of Houdini
G-Deini , Ronzoni noodles sprinkled on your embry
Climb like the deficit , profits , death threats
To Israel slid through Bethlehem bong on one wheel
Syringes , rubber bands , needles , the 60s
Granddaddy Caddy was copping Gs
Bgosh all that Oshkosh jumpers
Pink Champelle , brown paper bags , wall to wall bumpers

These aint the camera guys , cause , turn your eyes
Sweat on the hammer fly , Ways of the Samurai
Newsflash bulletin , Gods on the prowl
We full again , ruff men scuff Timbs
Sonic bionic lens , RZA console
Is it Bush or the Dole , front row of the Superbowl
Black gold in my soul , on ho stroll
Dont go boy you on parole you dont know ?

Someone in the back went , CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked , now bust your gun , CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went , CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked , now bust your gun , CLACK CLACK

Made em throw they hands up but then lay flat
Rat pack eat up , the average alley cat
Prepare for the impact when we contact
Known to drop facts that crack your hard hat
Must show and prove , trust , bust
Make your head spin like chrome 20s on the buggy-I Benz
Who contends , Wu like the Superfriends
Whos your rhyming hero ? Wu-Tang rules again

Someone in the back went , CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked , now bust your gun , CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went , CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked , now bust your gun , CLACK CLACK

Shake them niggas

Scary hours no money out , smash the Guinness Stout
Play the outfield , Lucille , switched cracks on shields
Shes rich fiend sacrifice her fam shift them niggas
To Queens
Guess jeans she charged thirty-five beans
Hit the cell phone , regulate with well known Tone
Wally kingpin who also slam the strike edition
What up ? Corleone smoke the bone , Tone phone me
What up ? He tried to slang there , address him with chrome only
Grady with the gray beard , transporting for him
Rocking Nike Air , Rastafarian bird , piping that
Switchin Benzes , ten carat nigga with gold lenses
Fronting like hes sitting on lump , hes sitting on junk
You wanna pull heist , draw guns and robberies
You wanna rock rep , step in yellow Wallabies
Names arraigned , the Century Fox , little Glocks
Them niggas with stocks , ______ blocks
Rich lifestyle , spoiled like an ordinary white child
But right now , Sun it still shine , shed light now
Breakdown , liquidate God , fucking grab the nickel plate
Spenser : For Hire , tension when we mention Dryer
Hes slave cop , behave pop
But Suze with beige top will blow that cat at the Purple Haze spot

remember sticking fiends at the one-six ooh
When we was starving , ducking five-oh , paying em dues
Times is hard in the slums Im from , they got us barred in
We warring and cage dodging , ripping and robbing
Got the NARC sabotaging , slipping cracks in
Your camoflouging , now you snitching on the squadron
Thats something niggas cant pardon
City overrun by young gun with bad intention and Wu-Wear garment
So see no need to mention , the potency
Of sting from killa bee , kicking the battery
Out the back of them wisecracks
Distorted for your get high , you hijack
These friendly skies aint for you , they for me and mine
This the year of the grimy nigga , ragtime
Keep these niggas on the run , peep my Clan emblem
Iron Lung aint got to tell you where its coming from

Catch us swimming with these sharks now , you rap villains
( feel the same way you niggas feeling )
We feel the same way you feeling , let it be known ( let it be known )
* together * What the blood clot you niggas dealing , you crash dummies
Cash rules , still dont nothing move but the money

Aiyyo strongarm that kid right there with wavy hair
Billy Johnson snatched him out his whip in Times Square
Took his Pumas , nameplate , dude lost weight
Summer 88 , started fight , that cant wait
Ask Dorothy , same kid pussy up in Marcy
Blazing that Ted Rossi up in The Marquees
He lost like hundred ounces , Jake rushed his houses
Had him on the porch , ass no trousers
This souped up , individual stuck , the new stuff
Same kid crying on the stand with Judge Cuffner
Kissed him with odd numbers three to nine style
Before he left he flashing his face like Denzel
Richard Dale took his Beaver , underwall balling his whip
Mussy dropped and split his wig with the heater
His shape-up was all fucked up , as he had me laughing
God you see how he was laid out in the grass
With dirt in his mouth , Slim woke him up told him he wild out
Blood leaking from his teeth he smiled like he gummed out
Big bolo , stacking his shit , financed Volvo
He copped his shit from small coffee shop in SoHo
He still pussy , he sell his dust up on the Lower East
Posing like he rapping out . . .
must tell you that the Clan is danger to the public
But still for many men just to hear of the name
Fills them with hate and loathing
But why ? Theyve never harmed anyone
Im afraid they did
* beat drops *
In the past theres something that they would like to forgive
First , Ill tell you about their style , planned techniques
The main style
" Shaolin Finger Jab ! "

Yo . .
* sounds of fighting *
( Uh-huh )

We are watchin your whole group
You been busy here
Around the clock , all we need is your orders to move
Met lot of crosses last night
Young and old !
You been busy here
respect that !

Yeah , ( Eh yo ) , yeah
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in ( Yo )
Come on ! You know what it is
( Thou must part seis all the time , kids )
( Eh yo , eh yo , eh yo ) Were back !

Peep The Jump Off , aint nothin sweet , get dumped off
Frontin like you wont get deaded and bumped off
Drastic son , master guns thatll run up in plastic ones
And then go , crash in the slums
One tight army , Few Good Men thatll rep
Invade your strongarm , Prince of Wales swimmin on feet
Props in sales , all yellow Ls , cops sleepin on nails
Niggas get realer than real , yo
Flash the brown , last time was crowned
All navy Woolridge , Wu kicks , movin them pounds , yo
Last on niggas , great adventures of my niggas
And cast out pictures , sendin rash out the kitchens
Like the wind , invite the grin , watch niggas rewrite the trend
Wu niggas did it again , yo
Unhighly , octane , die cast metal frame
Lame , let another man heat handle beef

Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in

Yo , spark the intro , relevant info
Load up the keyboard , 105 tempo
Most heated battles , Ive blasted MCs
Some said that the bullets flew by like angry bees
Wu entered on the level , then we would wait and listen
While one flashed metal , eight calculate position
The world snapped , once we combined our rap
Drastic measures , priceless treasures on Nap
Our swords swing , windchill Mount Aerie
Native plant standin on the tall-grass prairie
Snares and kicks , off the project bricks
Its no act the producer played the role with drumsticks
The warning came unnoticed , its like the shot " On the Dock of the Bay "
That slayed Otis , the Nine-Lotus
Each one adjust to his own environment
Formulate this great LP , hundred rounds spent
Niggas bent on fruitless search for nourishment
They long for this proper guidance encouragement


It be The Lost Tribe , Days locked in the dungeon
Foamin at the mouth , mad dog in this production
The Uncontrolled Substance got me spittin up nuff bars , disgustin
The last temptation of the son of David Ruffin
Hold my mic sideways when bustin
On Judgement Day runnin thru Hell , yellin and cussin
At MCs in my circumfrance , yall niggas hand-cuffin
These hoes and aint read them they rights or nothin
Keep lustin , yea , and Imma keep hustlin
With Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
You know me , everytime you kiss that ho you blow me
You blow trial trin to walk mile in my Sauconys


( AHHHHH ! ! ! ! )
We just touched down , Wu shuttle , private jet
Stepped off the plane , the world wept
Roll with the Witty Unpredictable
Talent All Natural , rock with the bangles of hip-hop
Mathematical imperial manifestation of greatness
Make wizes scream and shout at the top of their breath essence
Captured on tape is precious , bless mic pure defness
Awaken from you sleep mistake
When the God bring rain , hail , snow to the earthquake ! * echoes *


Youve been busy
Are you mastered ?
{ * Repeat 3x * }
Youve been busy here . .
1-2 , 1-2 1-2 , Im the emcee called Ice-T
Thats DJ Evil , Islam creates the beats
You girls look so sexy
wish you all were up here with me
You drive me crazy with them big ole butts
Girls , lets get butt naked and fuck

Tonight , Im trying to make this real clear , dear
Ive no time to whisper in your ear
No time to remove your fears
just wanna get near
Get butt naked and roll around
Move our bodies like up and down
Do that stuff that your mama call smut
Girls , lets get butt naked and fuck

Come on , you know you wanna do it too
Its good to me and its good to you
only speak whats true
You say you dont , but know you do
Come on up to my room
Well undress by the light of the moon
Lay down and Ill caress that butt
Girls , lets get butt naked and fuck

mean real stupid and nasty
know what you want , so you dont have to ask me
Just lay back and Ill operate
Jimbrowski will go to work and penetrate
And then well both feel great
Make your move tonight , girl dont hesitate
We both want it , dont make it tough
Girls , lets get butt naked and fuck

Homeboys , you know the situation
Youre trying to rap but they give you frustration
Nose in the air , turning you down
When you really wanna say , " Yo baby , lets get down "
But you dont , you keep fronting
Kicking conversation , aint talking bout nothing
When all thats really on your mind is what ?
" Yo baby , lets get butt naked and fuck "

Thats right , if youre man you want it
If youre woman , you tease him and flaunt it
But my crew got to have it
And after they dog it , autograph it
The Syndicate dont lecture
We move in group , seduce and capture
And if the posse has good luck
The girls will get butt naked and fuck that night

Islam takes the pictures
And girls , Imma say Evil Es gonna get ya
Get ya illing in nude mode
double X-rated episode
Hotel rooms cold explode when my posse unloads
Sex in effect when were on the road

Put your hands up in the air
If you love sex know youre out there
Safe sex that is
Ya gotta be careful with this 88 sex biz
But thats another song
Girls , move your bodies sexy and the brothers will come along
Homeboys , move in on that butt and say
Girls , lets get butt naked and fuck
in the morning , police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window make escape
Dont even get chance to grab my old school tape
Mad with no music , but happy cause free
And the streets to player is the place to be
Got knot in my pocket , weighing at least grand
Gold on my neck , my pistols close at hand
Im self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hip-hop beats
But just living in the city is serious task
Didnt know what the cops wanted , didnt have time to ask


Seen my homeboys cooling way way out
Told em bout my morning cold bugged em out
Shot little dice til my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories bout the night before
Posse to the corner where the fly girls chill
Threw action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started acting silly simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies , said we all werent shit
As we walked over to her , ho continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street
But just living in the city is serious task
Bitch didnt know what hit her , didnt have time to ask

Word

Continued clocking freaks with immense posterior
Rolling in Blazer with louie interior
Solid gold the ride was raw , bust left turn was on Crenshaw
Sean-e sean was the driver , known to give freaks hell
Had beeper goin off like high school bell
Looked in the mirror , what did we see
Fucking blue lights : . . .
Pigs searched our car , their day was made
Found an Uzi , . 44 and hand grenade
Threw us in the county high power block , no freaks to see no beats to rock
Didnt want trouble but the shit must fly , squabbled this sucker shanked em in the eye
But just living in the county is serious task
Nigga didnt know what happened , didnt have time to ask


Back on the streets after five and deuce
Seven years later but still had the juice
My homeboy Ken Gee put me up the track
Told me Es rolling Villain , BJs got the sack
Bruce is giant Nat Cs clocking dough
Be bops pimp , my old freaks ho
The batter rams rolling , rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said , man you out early , we thought you got ten
Opened his safe kicked me down with cold cash
Knew would get busy , he didnt waste time to ask


bought Benz with the money the rest went to clothes
Went to the strip started pimping the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when got it done on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint but fly to my heart
didnt want trouble but the shit had to start
Out with my crew , some punks got loud
Shot gun blasts echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit , two punks died
All causalities was applied to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didnt know who they were , no one had the time to ask


Swat team leader yelled , hit the floor
Reached in my pocket pulled my . 44
Dove across the room peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind Pinto
Out the back door like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley jumped into car
Suckers didnt even see us , they musta been blind
Black wire touched red the car was mine
We hadnt done nothing but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn , goddamn road block
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops wouldnt shot us on sight , they wouldnt took time to ask


The rollers gave chase at serious speed , one more conviction was all need
This shit was for real , it was no La-Di Da-Di
Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew , we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust corner doing 60 , one police car spun
And all was thinking was , murder one
Bust move into an alley and did it right
And me and my crew , were gone into the night
Broke to my old ladys who drew me bath
She didnt even know what happened , didnt care , didnt ask


We made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worlie , natural freak
She ran her tongue over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my Amadeus as watched TV
technician with mission thats what she was
If there had been crowd she would of got an applause
This girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done
The she backed off and teased me so couldnt cum
Then she cold got stupid pushed me on the floor
Had me begging to stop as was screaming for more
After she waxed by body she let me crash
She knew her loving was def , she didnt waste time to ask


Up the next morning , feeling good as hell
Sleeping with girlie sure beats cell
Hit the boulevard in my . .
Hos catching whiplash , trying to glimpse the
Ring on my mobile yes cellular
Got to have phone when Im in my car
Was my homeboy Red Some say hes insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smoking caine
Told me to meet him at the airport
Said hes jumping bail said he just left court
Caught the first thing smoking in serious dash
Didnt know where we were going , didnt care , didnt ask


Fell asleep on the plane and so did he , woke up chilling in . .
Called up my posse when got there , hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square
Rooftop devils nest the rest we passed , back doored the Palladium just for class
About . . we crashed the deuce , we never catch static cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads
Where shoot-out jumped off mine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with Mac-10 blast
But it was in the morning , we didnt wake up to ask

Intro

A-yo Ice , man . Im working on this term paper for college . Whats the First Amendment ?

Verse

Freedom of Speech , thats some motherfuckin bullshit
You say the wrong thing , theyll lock your ass up quick
The FCC says " Profanity No Airplay " ?
They can suck my dick while take shit all day
Think give fuck about some silly bitch named Gore ?
Yo PMRC , here we go , raw
Yo Tip , whats the matter ? You aint gettin no dick ?
Youre bitchin about rocknroll , thats censorship , dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got right to speak
Say what we want Tip , your argument is weak
Censor records , TV , school books too
And who decides whats right to hear ? You ?
Hey PMRC , you stupid fuckin assholes
The sticker on the record is what makes em sell gold
Cant you see , you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us , the larger we get

Verse

Fuck that right ! want the right to talk
want the right to speak , want the right to walk
Where wanna , yell and Im gonna
Tell and rebel every time Im on
Microphone on the stage cold illin
The knowledge drop will be heard by millions
We aint the problems , we aint the villains
Its the suckers deprivin the truth from our children
You cant hide the fact , Jack
Theres violence in the streets every day , any fool can recognise that
But you try to lie and lie
And say Americas some motherfuckin apple pie
Yo , you gotta be high to believe that
Youre gonna change the world by sticker on record sleeve
Cos once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the worlds up shit creek

Verse

Let me tell you about down south
Where motherfucker might as well not even have mouth
Columbus , Georgia , said theyd lock me up
If got on the stage in my show and said " Fuck "
So thought for minute and said " No
wasnt even gonna do damned show "
Cos for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen cos theres no sell outs on mine
But vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even arrested Bobby Brown and Cool
Yo , they got theirs comin , cos Im mad and Im gunnin
Homeboys , and theres no runnin
Im gonna tell you how feel about you
No bull , no lies , no slack , just straight fact
Columbus , Georgia , you can suck my dick
You aint nothin but piece of fuckin shit on the damned map

Verse

Freedom of Speech , let em take it from me
Next theyll take it from you , then what you gonna do ?
Let em censor books , let em censor art
PMRC , this is where the witch hunt starts
Youll censor what we see , we read , we hear , we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything , our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel , yell out whats real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours , my opinion is mine
If you dont like what Im sayin ? Fine
But dont close it , always keep an open mind
man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away

Outro ( Jello Biafra )

What theyre trying to do with radio , with this , uh , McCarran-Walter Act and lot of other ways , is start by saying that theyre protecting the public from wicked rock bands , or girlie magazines , or whatever . But , if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down what theyre really trying to do is shut off our access to information itself

If they cant do it by law they know theres other ways to do it

You know what Im sayin ?
This is Ice-T talkin to you boy
Imma tell you what time it is

Yo , its time for me to pump the volume
No problem , the records revolvin
Evils the mixer , Im the rap trixister
Paparazzi on the bum rush for pictures
Ice , coolin , yo colder than ever
Punk-Executioner , pull the lever
Rotate the wax then cut an axe the tracks
Push up the levels till the red lights max
Dont try to size up , you better wise up
To the rap criminals , were succeeded
Dope beats and lyrics , no beepers needed
For this drug deal , Im the big wheel
The dope Im sellin , you dont smoke , you feel
Out on the dance floor , on my world tour
Im sellin dope in each and every record store
Im the kingpin when the wax spins
Crack or smack will take you to sure end
You dont need it , just throw that stuff away
You wanna get high ? Let the record play

Aww man , like this dope here man

You know me , true friend
Your main boy , thick and thin
MC Ice-T

Bass thru the bottons , highs thru the tweeters
But this base you dont need pipe
Just tempo to keep your hype
Groovin like see you doin
Some stupid crack would just ruin
Your natural high , why ? . . That aint fly
And anyone who says it is , lies
Move like knew you would , like knew could
And if you aint cracked out , then know you should
Be able to give me clap , to match exact with the track
And since know that you aint , expect that
Oh now this jam is lit , its like the ultimate
People high off dope but still physically fit
Ill make million bucks , pack my dough in trucks
From sellin dope beats , dope rhymes , dope cuts
Ill be the biggest dope dealer in history
Because all the fly will be high off that Ice-T

Aww man , you aint ever lie man
This dopes alright man

Let me get your number man


Ill bring it to boil , Evil rock it up
You want it ? . . . dont think you got enough
Last suckers crossed , Syndicate shot em up
Cops found em in the lake bottom up

check my lyrics close , like with microscope
dont cleanem up with no Ivory soap
leave em hard and pure , hope that you can cope
Because you might . . if you overdrive
This record , tape or CD , because the sound Ive

No matter what they do , my stuff gets to you
Kickin on the Boulevard , my tempos hyped and hard
dont ask , the ICE just bogards
Sire Records puts me out , with Warner Bros . clout
My dope hits the streets with no doubt
Evil adds the cut , then removes it
IZ checks for purity , then approves it
And then you get it , try it and like it
And if it aint potent , we remix and spike it
To bring you the pure dope , not noose in rope
Because if youre doin crack , youre on death row
Youre just toy punk , to mess with that junk
You want some real dope , come look in my trunk
The dope Im sellin is life , 100 % legit
So get real fool , and try some real hit

Word up my brother
You got me high as kite
feel good tonight
Ice-T , you alright


Im your pusher
Yo Ease lets do this . . .

am nightmare walking , psychopath talking
King of my jungle just gangster stalking
Living life like firecracker quick is my fuse
Then dead as deathpack the colors choose
Red or Blue , Cuz or Blood , it just dont matter
Sucker die for your life when my shotgun scatters
We gangs of . . will never die just multiply

You see they hit us then we hit them
Then we hit them and they hit us , man
Its like war , ya know what Im sayin
People dont even understand
They dont even know what they dealing with
You wanna get rid of the gangs its gonna take lotta work
But people dont understand the size of this
This is no joke man , this is real

You dont know me , fool
You disown me , cool
dont need your assistance , social persistance
Any problem got just put my fist in
My life is violent but violent is life
Peace is dream , reality is knife
My colors , my honour , my colors , my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
Tell me what have you left me , what have got
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homie got jacked
My mothers on crack
My sister cant work cause her arms show tracks
Madness insanity live in profanity
Then some punk claimin they understandin me
Give me break , what world do you live in
Death is my sect , guess my religion

Yo my brother was gang banger
And all my homeboys bang
dont know why do it man , just do it
never had much of nuffin man
Look at you man , youve got everything going for yourself
And aint got nuffin man , Ive got nuffin
Im living in the ghetto man
Just look at me man , look at me

My pants are saggin braided hair
Suckers stare but dont care
My game aint knowelgde my games fear
Ive no remorse so squares beware

But my true mission is just revenge
You aint in my sect , you aint my friend
Wear the wrong color your life could end
Homocides my favorite venge

Listen to me man
No matter whatcha do dont ever join gang
You dont wanna be in it man
Youre just gonna end up in mix of dead freinds and time in jail
Know , if
had chance like you
would never be in gang man
But didnt have chance
You know wish did

Ill just walk like giant police defiant
Youll say to stop but Ill say that cant
My gangs my family its all that have
Im star , on the walls is my autograph

You dont like it , so you know where you can go
Cause the streets are my stage and terrors my show
Phsyco-analize tried diognising me wise
It was joke brother the brutally died

But it was mine , so let me define
My territory dont cross the line
Dont try to act crazy
Cause the bitch dont thank me
You can be read like punk
It wouldnta made me
Cause my colors death
Thou we all want peace
But our war wont end
Theyll always see

See the wars of the street gangs will always get to me man
But dont wanna be down with this situation man
But Im in here , if had something betta to do think Id do it but
Right
Now Im just down here boye
Im trying to get money cause Im smart
Im gunna get paid while Im out here
Im gunna get that paper , ya know what Im saying
If had chance like you
Maybe would be in school
But Im not , Im out here living day to day surviving
And Im willing to die for my colors

Yoll please stop , cause want ya all to live
This is Ice-T , Peace . . .

Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start locin up
United we stand divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga , but they cant take us alll
Lets get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Imagine that if it took place ( ha ha ha )
Keeping the smile off their white faces

Trace the hate face it
One nigga teach two niggas
Three teach four niggas
And them niggas teach more niggas
And when we blast
Thatll be the biggest blast youve heard
And them is my last words

He rocks the highs , dog the bass

Every day make sandwich with ham and cheese
Use miracle whip , dont like mayonnaise

Like doggin the wax and ya dont quit
And if you didnt like that then suck my . . . .
Dictations how write my raps
Cold maxin with two freaks upon my lap
Chillin on the phone , bookin more def shows

Ya say you like this record , you think its fun ?
Party people get stupid we just begun ! ! !

As the beat hits your body get ill ! ! !
You aint dumb you paid dollars to party go off ! !
The girl youre dancin with has got great hips bug out ! !
Go on homeboy and grab her . . . . .
Tape recorder turn up the bass
No time to waste just dog the place
R-R R-Rocket like missile in space
Evil keeps his 1200s in an anvil case
We fly . . . , Pan Am , . .
To places close to home , far away
. . , New York , Detroit , Miami
If see girl and like her then let her see my . . . .
Jam rockins how got my fame , Ice capital
Evil Es his name
If you cant see whos rockin you must be blind
You better clean your gazelles with some 409 ! ! !

Go Ice get busy ( x2 )
Go Evil Get busy ( X2 )

Turn up your stereo , equalize treble
Bass be kickin stupid hard as metal
On the mic tonight thats right your rhyme opponent
. . Ice just microphonin
33 and / revolutions per minute
This record is def because my heart is in it
Vocals laid by the Ice , tempos tight and precise
Special effects will be created by an editors splice
The funk is in it , ya dig it so stop that frontin
Bust move to my groove work your body do somethin
No way in the world that you can deny my method
As my record rotates , my words get more impressive
Im an . . , Evils my Dj on Sire Records not . .
. . . , Capitol , cause they move too slow
Now Sire / Warner Bros . clocks all the dough
As the record revolves moneys gettin made
. . . . . pays me every time its played
chill in def leathers pure silks and suede
And the gold around my neck will never fade
Down with my Syndicate organized rhyme
Kickin def tempos that design
And if you cant hearem thats such crime
You better wash your dirty ears with some 409

always rhyme elite , stay on beat
Travel in posse when walk the street
Loved to say my rhymes when used to max
Now dont speak much , save my words for wax
just wanna make little point in this song
With little nonsense we can all get along and on and on
Till the breaka break of dawn
This jam will never play out because the grooves too strong
Guys grab girl , girls grab guy
If guy wants guy , please take it outside
wanna make ya enjoy yourself
On the mic tonight Ice ! ! Who else ?
Evils on the cuts , Henry Gees shot gun
Islams my producer , Bambattas son
Bronx Style Bobs cold watchin my back
Melle Mels just layin for some punks to act wack
Grandmaster Caz and Donald , Scott La Rock
Red Alert , Chuck Chill Out
If youre down with my crew you will be fine
But if you ill well get dirty-bring your 409 ! !

( BREAK )

409 . . . . . .
in the morning , police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window make escape
Dont even get chance to grab my old school tape
Mad with no music , but happy cause free
And the streets to player is the place to be
Got knot in my pocket , weighing at least grand
Gold on my neck , my pistols close at hand
Im self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hip-hop beats
But just living in the city is serious task
Didnt know what the cops wanted , didnt have time to ask


Seen my homeboys cooling way way out
Told em bout my morning cold bugged em out
Shot little dice til my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories bout the night before
Posse to the corner where the fly girls chill
Threw action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started acting silly simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies , said we all werent shit
As we walked over to her , ho continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street
But just living in the city is serious task
Bitch didnt know what hit her , didnt have time to ask

Word

Continued clocking freaks with immense posterior
Rolling in Blazer with louie interior
Solid gold the ride was raw , bust left turn was on Crenshaw
Sean-e sean was the driver , known to give freaks hell
Had beeper goin off like high school bell
Looked in the mirror , what did we see
Fucking blue lights : . . .
Pigs searched our car , their day was made
Found an Uzi , . 44 and hand grenade
Threw us in the county high power block , no freaks to see no beats to rock
Didnt want trouble but the shit must fly , squabbled this sucker shanked em in the eye
But just living in the county is serious task
Nigga didnt know what happened , didnt have time to ask


Back on the streets after five and deuce
Seven years later but still had the juice
My homeboy Ken Gee put me up the track
Told me Es rolling Villain , BJs got the sack
Bruce is giant Nat Cs clocking dough
Be bops pimp , my old freaks ho
The batter rams rolling , rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said , man you out early , we thought you got ten
Opened his safe kicked me down with cold cash
Knew would get busy , he didnt waste time to ask


bought Benz with the money the rest went to clothes
Went to the strip started pimping the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when got it done on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint but fly to my heart
didnt want trouble but the shit had to start
Out with my crew , some punks got loud
Shot gun blasts echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit , two punks died
All causalities was applied to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didnt know who they were , no one had the time to ask


Swat team leader yelled , hit the floor
Reached in my pocket pulled my . 44
Dove across the room peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind Pinto
Out the back door like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley jumped into car
Suckers didnt even see us , they musta been blind
Black wire touched red the car was mine
We hadnt done nothing but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn , goddamn road block
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops wouldnt shot us on sight , they wouldnt took time to ask


The rollers gave chase at serious speed , one more conviction was all need
This shit was for real , it was no La-Di Da-Di
Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew , we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust corner doing 60 , one police car spun
And all was thinking was , murder one
Bust move into an alley and did it right
And me and my crew , were gone into the night
Broke to my old ladys who drew me bath
She didnt even know what happened , didnt care , didnt ask


We made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worlie , natural freak
She ran her tongue over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my Amadeus as watched TV
technician with mission thats what she was
If there had been crowd she would of got an applause
This girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done
The she backed off and teased me so couldnt cum
Then she cold got stupid pushed me on the floor
Had me begging to stop as was screaming for more
After she waxed by body she let me crash
She knew her loving was def , she didnt waste time to ask


Up the next morning , feeling good as hell
Sleeping with girlie sure beats cell
Hit the boulevard in my . .
Hos catching whiplash , trying to glimpse the
Ring on my mobile yes cellular
Got to have phone when Im in my car
Was my homeboy Red Some say hes insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smoking caine
Told me to meet him at the airport
Said hes jumping bail said he just left court
Caught the first thing smoking in serious dash
Didnt know where we were going , didnt care , didnt ask


Fell asleep on the plane and so did he , woke up chilling in . .
Called up my posse when got there , hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square
Rooftop devils nest the rest we passed , back doored the Palladium just for class
About . . we crashed the deuce , we never catch static cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads
Where shoot-out jumped off mine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with Mac-10 blast
But it was in the morning , we didnt wake up to ask

Back on the block

Ice-T , let me kick my credentials
young player , bred in South Central
. . , home of the bodybag
You wanna die , wear the wrong color rag
used to walk in stores and yell : " Lay down ! "
You flinch an inch AK spray down
But was lucky cause never caught the hard time
was blessed with the skill to bust dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds , cops towed their Benzos
Livin that life that we thought was it
Fast lanin , but the car flipped
Im not gonna lie to ya , cause dont lie
just kick thick game , some people say : why ?
Cause Im back on the block , got my life back
So school the fools about the fast track
get static from the style of my technique
Profanity , the blatant way in which speak
But the Dude knows the streets aint no kiddie game
You dont know the Dude ? Quincys his first name
He told me : " Ice , keep doin what youre doin , man
Dont give damn if the squares dont understand
You let em tell you what to say and what to write
Your whole careerll be over by tomorrow night
Rap from your heart , and your hearts with the street
Rap on my record , man , Kimiko , send Ice the beat "
The Dude is def no doubt , what can say ?
The man can roll with Ice-T or Michael

Back on the block
Back on the block

Im back , on the block , on the screen
Im on the wax , Im on the stage , Im on the scene
Im on the case , just like an attorney
The Dude took me on magic journey
To dance in France , alone in Rome
On the farmlands of Nebraska , the cold of Alaska
The heat of the motherland
To be with my brotherman
On top of snowcapped mountain Im scoutin
What another man saw in race of people
To see him give his life for the price of equal
The highest wisdoms , the richest kingdoms
The Song of Songs we heard David sing them
He showed me me when was young and hung out
He showed me makin love , even showed me strung out
He showed me poppin nines , standin on rock
But tears came to my eyes when he showed me my block

Stokies just Stokie , mama
( Stokies Stokie )
And one by one each woman he kiss
( He kiss her and she gon fall in love )
Stokies just Stokie , you know ?
( Stokies Stokie )
Till someone shows that they care enough
( Aint nothin gonna bother Stokie much )
Some say they cant take it no more
( Comin here , comin here startin stuff )
But Dude is back on duty fo sho
( Back on the block to stay )
They say he aint gonna be with it
( Comin back , comin back to the street )
But Dude he know youll never forget it
( Back on the block to stay )

Back up and give the brother room
To let poetry bloom to whom
It may concern or consume
As reminisce before this
The bliss that exist
But now we brought about twist
Cause remember of my people bleedin
Put through slavery and killed for bravery
We shoulda got our freedom much sooner
You never seen blackman on _The Honeymooners_
But now somehow weve learned to earn , to grow , to show
The elevation of people built is so
Jesse Jackson , Miss America black one
No more livin for just small fraction
was once told by the Dude that knowledge is food
To nourish , so to conclude
This from an Asiatic descendant , Big Daddy is shocked
Yo , we back on the block

Back

Back , on the block , so we can rock
With the soul , rhythm , blues , be bop and hip hop

Back on the block
Back on the block

An everlasting omnipresence is my present
State of being , seeing the unpleasant
Sight of righteous souls live like peasants
The mind stunts growth in adolescence
My insight enables me to enlight
The weakest of minds , and put em in flight
As transcend , a-scend or de-scend
Re-create , re-incarnate and re-send
The powerful spirits of our ancestors
For those that dont know how God blessed us
Because man messed up , the media dressed up
Lies perpetrated as truth , and it left us
Confused , but Ive seen it all before
] From Babylon to the Third World War
Im more than man , Im more like an entity
Back on the block , and this time my identity
Is the Dude

Ba-ba ba-back on the

Its going down , yo , the girl got gun
Best run , because she is , quick to flip and empty out the clip
And make the men understand where she is coming from
The hardcore is connected to the base of her fate
She just breaks and brings drama to the situation
Ejaculation of her projectile , she buckwild
Better recognize that she comes , she comes correct
Collects respect , and if not , youll catch broken neck , buddy
Look down and your shirt is all bloody
Looks like she caught you with the bad one
For messing with the mad one
Told you about this girl before , you didnt listen to me as talk
Now you stalked , by the hunter of the fronter
Whos size five and sexy
Quick to catch your body and another one next week
Huh , it doesnt matter cause the girl stays strapped
She said she had enough of men and now shes looking for payback ( WORD ! ! )
And theres no way that you can fade her son
She walks softly but she carries the big gun

She walks softly but she carries the big gun
She walks softly but she carries the big gun
She walks softly but she carries the big gun
[ Ice-T ] And theres no way that you can fade her son

The most venemous feminist , homey she aint soft
You give her trouble then she might cut your head off
Or something that you like to thinks the best
Shell blow big holes in your shest ( * Gun Shot * )
She said she gotta cause she says lot of ladies wont
She said she gotta cause she says lot of ladies dont
She said she gotta cause she says lot of ladies cant
She said she gotta cause she knows lot of ladies
Romance the thoughts of giving men their own medicine
Electrocute them , light them up like Con Edison
She got no fear , five rings in her ear
Holes in her nose , way out clothes
Living life to the fullest , buckshots and bullets
Triggers shell pull it , Earth she wanna rule it
Maybe she will , cause she is quick to kill
The city lights make her dresses tight , yes she bites
Youll never know where shell coming from
She walks softly but she carries the big gun


She got no time to trip or argue , youre through
bet she gets you
Homeboyll catch stretcher like so many before
She is on the Bodycount tour , but not rock
She couldnt suck the punks and cops
You say she is nothing but woman then youll come up shot
You say why you wanna kill me ? and she says why not !
Pop , she got body thatll make you cry
Pop , she got shotty thatll make you die
Dont bring drama to her homey , cause youll wind up flat
Shell put your ass horizontal then shell pull your cap
She got no love , and love is something that she never had
She loved the mother but she hated the motherfucking dad
So stay the hell out of her way , cause the girl dont play , none
She walks softly but she carries the big gun

She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
[ Ice-T ] So dont even try to play her son
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
[ Ice-T ] So dont even try to front son
once knew this brother
Who thought was cool with me
Chilled out together
Even went to school with me
Fly nigga , my ace boon coon
Used to low ride together
Shot dice in the bathroom
Ya want trouble ?
Well trouble ya found
Cause we diss ya , then issue
The critical beat down
He needed money
would always come through
Needed car ? He could use mine too
But bust this !
Out on the street
People say he was riffin
Callin me sucker
Talkin bout how foul Im livin
Someone heard him
Poppin that shit last week
Frontin for some pussy
From some big-butt freak
Sayin Im his worker
was on his dick !
Talkin that craazy old weak assed shit
And after all of that
She still walked away
How ya gonna diss your boy
To get some play ?
And when stepped to him about it
He said , " Who snitched ? "

Yo , how did he go out ?
He went out like bitch !
So ladies
We aint just talkin bout you
Cause some of you niggas
Is bitches too !

knew this brother named Mitch
Stone player
He meet girl , in five min . he lay her
Trucked crazy jewels
Hands smothered in ice
Been to prison not once , but twice
Kept stupid thick posse
Made of thugs and
Crooks and hoods
And vet hustlers
Who were up to no good
But they all stood behind him
And watched his back
Thats the only way
To roll on the track
But yo
Mitch got rushed by feds last week
The snatchbared the runk
Of his white Corniche
Took look inside
And what did they see ?
Two keys , and gallon of PCP !
Oh shit ! The thought crashed
Mitchs subliminal
Three strikes , thats called
Habitual criminal
So insted of goin under
He snitched on his whole posse
Maxed at the crib
And sipped Martini and Rossi
Sold out his whole crew
That rat named Mitch


knew this guy
That was never that fly
Couldnt act cool
Even when he tried
When we played rough
He always cried
When he told stories , he always lied
Black brother
Who was missin the cool part
He had the color
But was missin the true heart
When we would fight
He would always go down quick
So he took karate
And he still got his ass kicked
But now hes married
And he kicks his wifes ass
Says it comes from problems
That he had in the past
Doesnt like Blacks
Claims hes upper class
Joined the police , got himself badge
Now he rolls the streets
And hes cut to jack
Doggin young brothers
Cause they usually dont fight back
Got White partner
And he asked for that
And every night
Another head they crack
So now hes big man
But he really aint shit !


Out one night with my crew
And some new kid
didnT know homeboy , but Evil did
So thought he was cool
We rode in his ride
Rag top tray on Daytons
Lifted side to side
We hit the party deep
Niggas was hawkin me
You could feel the vibe
Of thick artillery
Parliament was on , some . . shit
put my back to the wall
And felt my pistol grip
Al of sudden
Niggas started trippin
Flippin , the record started skippin
Wildin , fools started locn up
Gats cracked
The room started smokin up
Me and " " hit the floor
And then the back door
My boys let off an automatic encore
But when we made it out to the ride
It was gone , we had to shoot it out
Side by side
Punk left us there to die in ditch !


So if youre wonderin why we lookin at you funny , its cause
( some of you niggas are bitches )
You always tell brother youre gonna loan him money but you dont cause
( some of you niggas are bitches )
Yo , Aladdin , you know why they be frontin ? Imma tell you why

You always act like you can fight , but when its real fight you find out

Ice-T , after your tremendous success on your past album
Some have said ; you have sold out
Because of the use of rocknroll in your music
How do you reply to that ?

You see , lotta people dont realize that , you know
RockNRoll is truely black music
It was created by Chuck , Berry , Little Richard
Even black people like that , who started it off back in the day
You know , and as far as Im concern music is music
dont look at it as Rock or & all that kind of stuff
just look at it as music , you know
And anybody who said that Ive sold out , they can basically suck my dick
Cause really dont give fuck about that shit , you know
But uhh . . do what like , havent like RockNRoll
And uhh . . feel sorrow for anybody who only listens to one form of music
You know , right now , got my own Rock band , its got to jump off
Its really black hardcore band called Body Count
And uhh . . on some of the records Im like laying some vocals on it
And uhh . . got tape of it right here , yo , check it out

You know , sometimes sit at home , you know , and watch TV
And wonder what would be like to live in some place like
You know , The Cosby Show , Ozzie and Harriet
You know , where Cops come and got your cat outta the tree
All your friends died at old age
But you see . . live in South Central , Los Angeles
And unfortunately . . . SHIT AINT LIKE THAT ! !
Its real fucked up !

God damn , what brother gotta do
To get message through
To the red and white and blue
What ? gotta die before you realize

The worlds insane while you drink champagne

With case of hand grenades

( Tell us what to do ? ) Fuck you !
( Tell us what to do ? ) Fuck you !
( Tell us what to do ? ) Fuck you !
( Tell us what to do ? ) Fuck you !

Youd know what to do

This motherfucker , wouldve died for this nigga man
And this nigga set me up ?

Youre now fucking with your last nigga
Quick to blast nigga
Gauge Masturbator
Chest Plate disintegrator , rider
never wore no mask , wacked the witness vestless
Ill put you on the graveyards guest list
ICE cause lack all emotions , Im heartless
Thats why cant figure for the life of me
Youd want to start this
My crew is bottomless
Street Lobotomists
Gun slingers
Glock cocked and diamond ringers
Hustlers
My nigga got shot but still alive
He took full clip from another players 25
And he said hes rolling with me , if youre coming
told him , stay home , rest up , got enough gunning
Homiciders
Ballin rag Rolls riders
Blood letters
Money getters
Life betters
The last thing heard you say you said was dead man , bitch
Ill put you right into gun point , you snitch
Now know your plans are rolling on me , late when sleep
Why dont we do this man to man ? Let them bitch niggas creep
still remember in the days when we was friends chillin
Now it seems you going to have to be my next killin

Chorus x2 :
You wanna go to war , nigga tell me why ?
Punk niggas talk shit , bitch niggas die
never backed down and it aint no time to start
Lets take it to the streets and Im check your heart

You must be death wishing , whats up ? You know my steelo
Got love with the illest of blacks and amigos
Your jealousy is outta hand , cant fuck witcha
And all your so-called down niggas , say good luck to ya
They know youre off the hook and youre soon to bleed
My reputation states that kills with speed
More drama than rap verse
Youll feel the mack first
In your back first
Then the black hearse
Goddamn , cant understand the drama why ?
To tell the fucking truth thought your crew was fly
Now youre talking that shit like bitch on the rag
Dont give fuck about your set or the pants you sag
drop hot one in your forehead , neck and mouth
Then rush hospital and bank ya if you dont check out
Cause Im mad nigga once , crazy nigga twice
cold blooded motherfucker , thats why they call me ICE
And if you told me this would happen
would said never no , we down forever we flipped keys together
Now the street talkers say you want my spot
lotta niggas did , lotta niggas shot

Chorus

Its obvious some sucka niggas got ya gassed
Lets see if they around you when the gunshots blast
It aint nothing nice , letting off slugs under the street life
Early deaths , dry gags and last breaths
seen your time before you want war till its on
How to fuck with the king , when youre bullshit pawn ?
cant comprehend your stupidity , miscalculation
Word to obstetricians show your crews anhiliation
Predicted , Brains get evicted , Fuckin with me kid
Bullets lift your lid
And watch your weak kool aid heart run down the drain
got the Method Man who came to bring the pain
Let you know quick , niggas suck dick if you trip
Used to be my homie , now you just punk ho bitch
Frustration leads to aggravation and dismay
Now youre player haten , but thats the wrong game to play
light your block up , kidnap your moms snatch your woman
You beg for me to stop , but Ill just keep coming
Youre fucking with the illest fool in Southern California
can roll with ya , or motherfuckin on ya

Chorus x2

Yeah , know the real nigga can feel this
This is dedicated to all my " friends "
Yo Ease lets do this . . .

am nightmare walking , psychopath talking
King of my jungle just gangster stalking
Living life like firecracker quick is my fuse
Then dead as deathpack the colors choose
Red or Blue , Cuz or Blood , it just dont matter
Sucker die for your life when my shotgun scatters
We gangs of . . will never die just multiply

You see they hit us then we hit them
Then we hit them and they hit us , man
Its like war , ya know what Im sayin
People dont even understand
They dont even know what they dealing with
You wanna get rid of the gangs its gonna take lotta work
But people dont understand the size of this
This is no joke man , this is real

You dont know me , fool
You disown me , cool
dont need your assistance , social persistance
Any problem got just put my fist in
My life is violent but violent is life
Peace is dream , reality is knife
My colors , my honour , my colors , my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
Tell me what have you left me , what have got
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homie got jacked
My mothers on crack
My sister cant work cause her arms show tracks
Madness insanity live in profanity
Then some punk claimin they understandin me
Give me break , what world do you live in
Death is my sect , guess my religion

Yo my brother was gang banger
And all my homeboys bang
dont know why do it man , just do it
never had much of nuffin man
Look at you man , youve got everything going for yourself
And aint got nuffin man , Ive got nuffin
Im living in the ghetto man
Just look at me man , look at me

My pants are saggin braided hair
Suckers stare but dont care
My game aint knowelgde my games fear
Ive no remorse so squares beware

But my true mission is just revenge
You aint in my sect , you aint my friend
Wear the wrong color your life could end
Homocides my favorite venge

Listen to me man
No matter whatcha do dont ever join gang
You dont wanna be in it man
Youre just gonna end up in mix of dead freinds and time in jail
Know , if
had chance like you
would never be in gang man
But didnt have chance
You know wish did

Ill just walk like giant police defiant
Youll say to stop but Ill say that cant
My gangs my family its all that have
Im star , on the walls is my autograph

You dont like it , so you know where you can go
Cause the streets are my stage and terrors my show
Phsyco-analize tried diognising me wise
It was joke brother the brutally died

But it was mine , so let me define
My territory dont cross the line
Dont try to act crazy
Cause the bitch dont thank me
You can be read like punk
It wouldnta made me
Cause my colors death
Thou we all want peace
But our war wont end
Theyll always see

See the wars of the street gangs will always get to me man
But dont wanna be down with this situation man
But Im in here , if had something betta to do think Id do it but
Right
Now Im just down here boye
Im trying to get money cause Im smart
Im gunna get paid while Im out here
Im gunna get that paper , ya know what Im saying
If had chance like you
Maybe would be in school
But Im not , Im out here living day to day surviving
And Im willing to die for my colors

Yoll please stop , cause want ya all to live
This is Ice-T , Peace . . .
The underworld watches in horror
As this marks the day that
of Americas most notorious outlaws
Will be executed for their crimes

Together the states of Michigan and California
Will conduct the executions behind prison walls
The prisoners are set to be executed by separate methods
Electric chair , hanging , and firing squad
Midnight tonight will mark the first execution

Death waits in my cell can smell him
Somebody tell him that still breathe , leave
Im alive Ill never see 25
Yet still can feel , Im real
When it all happened was in the lime light
News , camera , gaven killer stamina
Another year Im here but forgotten
Skin is rotting feeling old , cold
Motherfucker in robe gonna sentence me to die in metal chair
Fizzle my nut hair
Bad enough Ill be dead
Yet Im tryin to figure out way
To keep my eyes from poppin out my head
Oh theyll remember my ass
Twitchin , with my eyes drippin down the glass
Shaggy think theyre tryin to start riot
And then its Ice but he dont seem fazed by it
know the devils waitin on me
But does God like him playin his role in killin me though
Lock me up until die maybe
But you can never tell
We might sharing cell in hell
Cause , my last request was
Let my homies smoke my ashes and catch Violent buzz
One more thing before you hit that switch
Please tell my momma that Im sorry , never

( Chorus x2 )
Dead end no escape from it
Shouldve thought about that shit before you done it
Why ? , never wanna die
Dont nobody cry for me , its only murder

The lights dimmed in my cell block
Cause all the power they got surged into one spot
Js chair hear him screamin , fully loaded
It was funny at first till his head exploded
Its something else for me
Another kill just as wicked
But cheaper on the light bill
It all starts with thick rope
Make noose and Im gone
Stretch out my neck bone
Minutes left think about my brother
When we was young . . .
Wait dont have brother
What the fuck ?
My minds in tangle
wish somebody was here that could strangle
keep waking up on the floor
Cause strangle myself but what the fuck for ?
Haha starin at the cracks on the walls
Whistlin necks , fidgetin my balls
Kill me itll still all be the same
Wicked clown Juggalo phantom of the night train
What if drop , but dont die
Tie weights to my legs
And give it another try
Still coming think of something , speak
Im not feelin so hot lets go for it next week
Didnt work , pulled down my collar
At least they wont be hearin me holla
My neck shut

( Chorus x2 )
Dead end no escape from it
Shouldve thought about that shit before you done it
Why ? , never wanna die
Dont nobody cry for me , its only murder

[ bit past : 30 . . now
And the 3rd prisoner slowly makes his way
To the disignated spot on prison grounds
Where he will be executed by way of firing squad ]

got seven bitches aiming at me
My backs against the wall
If only had my strap then could plug em all
Watch em fall
But they got my ass tied up behind this wall
So the homies cant ride up
Known killer in fact killed the most
At random though some of them planned em
Fuck it , kicked your bucket for you , floor you
Got more guns if theres more of ya
War with the cops no prob
They shouldnt took the job
Blow holes throught they heads like donuts
Grown-ups , kids and girls
Gather round and get gunned down
do it for the fun of it , adrenaline rush
Coked up quick to bust
Plus love my dust
Gun son , watch the blood run son
Im on one , muthafuckas
But check it this time Ill be the one dissected
cant wait to feel the heat when lead and flesh meets
Bitter sweet baby , been waiting for this
Go straight to hell kick it with the rest of my clique
Fuck blindfold wanna look em deep in they eyes
So they can see the fools face of dog as he dies
Plus wanna see the muthafuckas squeeze
got hot date with my soul mate
Bust cant wait

( Chorus x4 )
Dead end no escape from it
Shouldve thought about that shit before you done it
Why ? , never wanna die
Dont nobody cry for me , its only murder

While all . . fuckin mess

Bush has got his upper cut

We aint got shit , now had enough
Chaos , chaos , chaos , chaos

Disorder ! ! ! ( x8 )
Cruisin for bruisin , Im talkin no crap
Pipe bomb in my trunk , got nine in my lap
Im layin for sprayin , tonight theres no playin
My posses most strapped , tonight the crews weighin
Dust is burnin , the steering wheels turnin
Im out week , Im already earnin
Suckers crossed , tonight its their loss
Payback time , boy , lifes the cost
Gauges out the window , one lay cross the roof
They all die if those suckers aint bullet proof
Im rollin death tollin , of course the cars stolen
But Im blind to whats wrong , all want is whats golden
fool in fight , too dumb to know right
Fuckin blue light-readem their rights

Drama ( x4 )

Copped an alias bailed out in an hour or less
keep bank for that dont know about the rest
Copped another piece , hit the dark streets
Rollin once again , fuck the damn police
Called up my friend JOE , roof job pro , 459 on his mind car stereos
He said the spot was sleep , he cased the joint week
. . on the dot inside we creep
Got Alpines , Fishes , JVCs
Motorola Phones , Sony Color TVs
Had the hide packed up till we heard freeze
Fuckin blue lights-readem their rights

Drama ( x4 )

in the morning , lights in my face
Thats the time , you know the place
Cuffed in the room with the two-way glass
Detects in effect cold doggin my ass
" Whats your date of birth ? " . . . " Whats your real name ? "
stuck to my alias , know the game
If they dont know who you are , then they dont know what youve done
" Youre just makin this harder on yourself , son "
know this shit by heart , Im too clever
" Have you ever been arrested before ? "
" Nope , never "
Da reject all over his face
You see no confession , no case
Then my boy started illin , talkin and tellin
Son of bitch-he was snitch

Drama ( x6 )

Under went , caught case and half
He dropped the mallet , then the judge laughed
Now Im in the penzo , chillin like real pro
cant move until the man says go
puppet of the big game , an institutional thing
wouldnt be here if fed my brain
Got knowledge from school books , instead of street crooks
Now all get is penitentiary hard looks
The joint is like an oven of caged heat
Youre just number , another piece of tough meat
Killers and robbers are all you great
Act soft you will get beat
On death row they got their own hot seat
For those who feel that they are truly elite
The last thing you sees priest
The lights dim-your life ends

Drama
Ex D-Boy used to sell that girl
Now , they know my name all across the world
They say Earl , EARL ! !
They say Earl , EARL ! !

Im from Vallejo , California , land of the homer
Sides lost lives , politics and drama
Over supersize , thump young in hornya
Watch out for that boy in the hoodie , man , he monster
Light sucker up , fried buster like Chimichanga
Somebody come scoop his ass , call coroner
guess thats the way we bread
Chemical babies mislead
Its spooky out here in the Yay
These goblins will get on your head
These thundacats management aint scared to be deceased
They always cover up they ears
When Im yelling and hollering out peace !
They going through it , they cranky , stressed out and tense
They starving , they hungry , they eating soup with chopsticks
Plus , its shortage on purple , and its drought on them bricks
So hell go decide to do kick door , and pull few licks
Some of them parents on drugs , some of them never been loved
Some of them want to be thugs , some of them just need hug


Imma be around for minute
So get used to it , was through with it
Before most of you marshmallows knew want to do with it
Pushing them zones , serving that drome
Balling like play hoop with it
Never at home , always be gone
Doing show on the verse split
Let it be known , tote my chrome
Refuse to get caught loose with it
Looking down at my shoe with it , Imma real baboon with it
40 over there slipping , he snoozing , he aint wake
He looking like plate , he chipped up and draped
You fuck niggas got me fucked up , nigga , Im shooter
Think about the consequences , nigga , got gouda
And niggas with gouda will send nigga , fuck case
Cause niggas with gouda will have your whole family erased
But that aint something endorse , only wore it by force
Im trying to teach the youth to be loyal and play sports
Instead of in and out of court
And back and forth to prison , utilize they skills
And stay up out the system


Im from Vallejo , California
The land of the homer
Sides lost lives , politics and drama
Sides lost lives , politics and drama
Sides lost lives , politics and drama

E-40 nigga , this aint no motherfucking news to you , man
This nigga been running the motherfucking Yay
Running the motherfucking Bay for years now , nigga
These niggas dont play , this is Vallejo , California
Nigga , you heard about it
Iceberg , nigga
Let me tell ya little story
Bout my homeboy Ed
Use to drink every day
Straight 40s to the head
You try to snap on him
Hed ask what you said
You still try to break
Hed start given up lead
Love to gamble
On one knee he stayed
Tryin to hit seven
On one knee he stayed
Worked tees and weights
So he always got paid
Blew on the hoes
Every dollar he made
Crazy friends , crazy friends he had
Superfly drobe , super dope pad
Cars for your ass
And Im talkin class
Benzs and better
With his name on the dash
One night he got drunk
And started drivin real fast . . .

Eds dead
Here we go
Im movin off death row
Ya gotta keep up hops
Ya cant be slow
Cause their towers are high
They got the hype gats
Check the perimeters good
Read the maps
Its night
They might not see us
Cause if they catch us out there
Theyll bleed us
Shoot us , kill us
Dump us in dark ditch
Clean it up , call it gang hit
gotta make my move
Cause Im renegade
recognize
When mind techniques
Are being played
Its plot they use
To keep down another
Here comes another
Brainwashed brother

" Yo man , it sounds like youre selling out to me , cause Im from the ghetto , lived in the ghetto all my life
We aint supposed to leave here , were black . . . were supposed to be poor . "

Shut up do you know
How dumb you sound ?
That mentality
What keeps my people down
No one wants to
Live in an urban war
You live there cause
Your parents were poor
They live there because
Theirs were also
Get yourself together
Hit the gates bro !

CHORUS
Ya gotta get out !
Ya gotta get out ! Why ?
Ya gotta get out !
Ya gotta get out ! Why ?
Ya gotta get out !
Ya gotta get out ! Why ?
Cause the fields
Are where you die !
Escape from
The killing fields

You try to keep us
Running and running faster
But aint runnin from ya
Im runnin at ya
And my posses thick
About mil strong
Too late to make up now
Cause its on
Im the one thats got ya
In constant fear
Im the nigga
You shoulda killed last yeaar
But you played yourself
You let me gain wealth
Now can change the way
The cards are dealt
Ive schooled my homeboys
Made em all understand
The tricks and twists
Inflicted on the Black man
How ya make me think
To be down
gotta stay around
Down in the motherfuckin
Battleground

" We got the Puerto Ricans where we want em , we got the Mexicans and the Blacks where we want em
Well shit , theyre all Black we gotta keep em together , the same way we got those fuckin Indians . "

Therell never be any good
Schools in the hood
Therell never be any cops
That are any good
The hospital is great place
To go to die
Real estates cheap
Let me tell ya why ?
The mans got
Sure fire system

CHORUS

( Ohhh shit . . what happened ? )

FUCKED HER
Upon initial contact with Ice-Ts music , had envisioned him to be an ill-mannered and psychologically unstable man with an extremely uneducated and barbaric frame of mind , whose raps displayed nothing but ridiculous jargon , shocking sexual audacity , and repulsive images of the ghetto

However , after further analysis of his music can deduce that he is the epitome of antidisestablishmentarianism who embodies the entire spectrum of the urban experience and struggle

But to make things more plain and Simple to the layman , find Ice-T to be the dopest , flyist , . . , pimp , hustler , gangster , player , hardcore motherfucker living today

To be honest , Im totally and irrevocably on his dick
Intro

A-yo Ice , man . Im working on this term paper for college . Whats the First Amendment ?

Verse

Freedom of Speech , thats some motherfuckin bullshit
You say the wrong thing , theyll lock your ass up quick
The FCC says " Profanity No Airplay " ?
They can suck my dick while take shit all day
Think give fuck about some silly bitch named Gore ?
Yo PMRC , here we go , raw
Yo Tip , whats the matter ? You aint gettin no dick ?
Youre bitchin about rocknroll , thats censorship , dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got right to speak
Say what we want Tip , your argument is weak
Censor records , TV , school books too
And who decides whats right to hear ? You ?
Hey PMRC , you stupid fuckin assholes
The sticker on the record is what makes em sell gold
Cant you see , you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us , the larger we get

Verse

Fuck that right ! want the right to talk
want the right to speak , want the right to walk
Where wanna , yell and Im gonna
Tell and rebel every time Im on
Microphone on the stage cold illin
The knowledge drop will be heard by millions
We aint the problems , we aint the villains
Its the suckers deprivin the truth from our children
You cant hide the fact , Jack
Theres violence in the streets every day , any fool can recognise that
But you try to lie and lie
And say Americas some motherfuckin apple pie
Yo , you gotta be high to believe that
Youre gonna change the world by sticker on record sleeve
Cos once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the worlds up shit creek

Verse

Let me tell you about down south
Where motherfucker might as well not even have mouth
Columbus , Georgia , said theyd lock me up
If got on the stage in my show and said " Fuck "
So thought for minute and said " No
wasnt even gonna do damned show "
Cos for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen cos theres no sell outs on mine
But vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even arrested Bobby Brown and Cool
Yo , they got theirs comin , cos Im mad and Im gunnin
Homeboys , and theres no runnin
Im gonna tell you how feel about you
No bull , no lies , no slack , just straight fact
Columbus , Georgia , you can suck my dick
You aint nothin but piece of fuckin shit on the damned map

Verse

Freedom of Speech , let em take it from me
Next theyll take it from you , then what you gonna do ?
Let em censor books , let em censor art
PMRC , this is where the witch hunt starts
Youll censor what we see , we read , we hear , we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything , our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel , yell out whats real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours , my opinion is mine
If you dont like what Im sayin ? Fine
But dont close it , always keep an open mind
man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away

Outro ( Jello Biafra )

What theyre trying to do with radio , with this , uh , McCarran-Walter Act and lot of other ways , is start by saying that theyre protecting the public from wicked rock bands , or girlie magazines , or whatever . But , if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down what theyre really trying to do is shut off our access to information itself

If they cant do it by law they know theres other ways to do it
Artist : Ice-T / Jello Biafra
Album : The Iceberg
Freedom Of Speech , Just Watch What You Say . . .
Song : Shut Up , Be Happy

We interrupt this program with special bulletin :
America is now under marshall law
All constitutional rights have been suspended
Stay in your homes
Do not attempt to contact love ones , insurance agent or attorney
Shut up
Do not attempt to think or depression may accure
Stay in your homes
Curfew is at PM sharp after work
Anyone gaught outside of gates of their suveillance sectors after curfew
Will be shot
Remain calm , do not panic
Your neighborhood watchofficer will be by to collect urine examples in
The morning
Anyone gaught intefering with the collection of urine examples will be
Shot
Stay in your homes , remain calm
The number one enemy of progress is question
National security is more important than individual will
All port broadcasts will proceed as normal
No more than two people may gather anywhere without promission
Use only the drugs described by your boss or supervisor
Shut up , be happy
Obey all orders without question
The comformental mandor is now mandatory
Be happy
At last everything is done for you
You know the deal , its just me , yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my people , negroes and latinos
And even the gringos

Yo , check it one for Charlie Hustle , for Steady Rock
for the forthcoming live future shock
Its dimensions , senses
firmaments of heaven and hell , Million Stories to tell
planets faithfully keep in orbit
With the probable tenth , the universe expands length
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
Im blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide project-prison industry complex
Working-class poor : better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep , its dangerous to dream
For your chain , Cats j-j pow ! You dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
Its numbers game , but shit dont add up somehow
Like got , 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15 % of profits ever see my pockets like
69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like
Nearly half of Americas largest cities is one-quarter black
Thats why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to pound , 20 more to ki
5-minute sentence hearing and youre no longer free
40 % of Americans own cell phone
So they can hear everything that you say when you aint home
guess Michael Jackson was right : " You Are Not Alone "
Rock your hardhat , black , cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas , large niggas , dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers , crack babies and AIDS patients
Young bloods cant spell but they could rock you in PlayStation
This new math is whipping motherfuckers ass
You want to know how to rhyme you better learn how to add
Its mathematics

" The Mighty Mos Def " " its simple mathematics "
" Check it out " " revolve around science . . "
" What are we talking about here "
" Do your math "
" , , , "
" What are we talking about here "

Its one universal law but sides to every story
strikes and you be in for life , mandatory
MCs murdered in the last years
aint trying to be the fifth one , the millennium is here
Yo its Million Ways to Die , from the deadly thrills
8-year olds getting found with 9mils
Its 10 . . , where your seeds at ? Whats the deal ?
He on the hill pumping krill to keep they belly filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel , sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn their next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe youve got to find new grind to get . . . .
The white unemployment rate ? Its nearly more than triple for black
Some front-liners got their gun in your back
Bubbling crack , jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still living
Join the other million under state supervision
This is business : no faces , just lines and statistics
From your phone , your zip code to S-S digits
The system break man , child , and women into figures
columns for " who is " and " who aint niggas "
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard , even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camels back ?
Heres the secret
The million other straws underneath it : its all mathematics
know cant afford to stop
For one moment , that its too soon to forget

Man , duke was in love with this girl , duke
was tore up dog , Im telling you man
Shit is wild man , for real
Its , shes from , let me tell you about her

In she came with the same type game
The type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name
Big fame , she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped , money clip , phone flip , the six range
seen her on the Ave , spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi , shot me glance
In that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants , hot damn !
Whats your name love , where you came from ?
Neck and wrist laced up , very little make-up
The swims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of ?
tried to play it low key , but couldnt keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like , " Yo , Im leaving now "
An hour later , sounds from Jamaica
She sipping Cris straight up , shaking , winding her waist up
Scene : my fam throwing the jam
Fareed is on the stand , big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
" Ayo , this my man Mos , baby , let me introduce "
turned around ( Say word ! ) it was the same pretty bird
Who had priorly observed trying to play me for the herb
Shocked as hell she couldnt get it together
just played along and pretended never met her
How you feeling ? " Oh , Im fine " My name is Mos " Im Sharice "
heard so much good about you , its nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sitting directly next to me
Im type polite but now Im looking at her skeptically
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric , shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes , sweet voice is fucking with me mentally
We conversated , made her laugh , yeah , you know me bro
Even though know the steelo , she wild sweet , yo
Im bout to murk , say peace to the family
She hop up like , " How you gon leave before you dance with me ? "


She blew my whole head with that duke , was like , word ?

Niggas was mad , niggas was so sick , tell ya
Yo , honey was so blazing she was just
Yo , she looked like Jayne Kennedy , word bond , to my mother man
She was that ill man , she take me to the dance floor
And she start whispering to me and shit

" Yo , let me apologize for the other night
know it wasnt right , but baby you know what its like
Some brothers dont be coming right , understand , Im feeling you
Besides , can have dance aint really that original "
We laughed about it , traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playing Lovers Rock , got the folded fingers on her waist
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered , " Honey , lets exchange numbers "
Scene : weeks of dating late night conversation
In the crib heart racing , trying to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids , the room fell silent
She walked away smiling , singing Gregory Isaacs
Like , " If dont , if dont have you "
Showing me her tan line and her tattoo
Playing Sade , Sweetest Taboo
Burning candles , all my other plans got cancelled
Man smashed it like Idaho potato
She call me at my . . , come now , cant say no
Ginseng tree trunks , rocking the P-funk
Cocking her knees up , champion lover not ease up
Three months , she call feel Im running fever
Six months , Im telling her desperately need her
Nine months , flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
need more than to knock it down , Im really trying to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn stoge and let her know , sweetheart got to have it
She telling me commitment is something she cant manage
Wake up the next morning , she gone like it was magic
Ahh , damn it , my shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My 911s unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week , Mu hit me up , saw Sharice at the Kittie club
With some banging ass Asian playing lay it down and lick me up

Youre just hoping you dont get roped for your throat get choked anything
Oh and just think how dope he could be if he smoked anything
Oh , there goes the bell , the sound of the opening ding
hit you as hard as barbiturates in the ribs with switch
And stitch you at the same time before you can flinch to it
My dick is so big , if add another inch to it
You would swear when raped you that you was actually into it
Im not baller but you can bet your fuckin bottom dollar
That remember when was without dollar bill in my wallet
Now watch me kill koala while maul chihuahua
Bum pill off of Paula like let me holler at you , mama

Mail gift to Taylor Swifts trailer picture
Of my genitalia with note saying " bitch , cant wait to nail ya "
Drug paraphernalia beware the werewolf will kill ya
Thats him in the sheeps clothes ; he just shaved his hair off Cecilia
If say surely the darkness shall fall on me
Even the night shall be light about me
Indeed the darkness shall not hide from you
But the night shines as the day
The darkness and the light are both alike unto you
Amen

Thou preparest table before me
In the presence of mine enemies
Thou anointest my head with oil
My cup runnneth over
Amen

Run

Pure pedigree horse power
Balley at the summer buffalo soldier hour
Black and blue dawn in the shadow lands
Dub cry high-noon make the shadows dance
Preacher man say prayer , bless the caravan
Bandolero clans and jackels in the valley pass
Mindset on the treasures and the talisman
Hand set on the holy book and battle axe
Sun , moon , and stars , built map
Where you at
Frontier
Clear
Expansion , exodus , run
Frontier
Clear
Exodus , expansion ( run )

They die by dawn
They die by dawn
They die by dawn
They die by dawn
They die by dawn
They die by dawn

My grandmother told me
Never ever go to sleep in the church house
Wear shirt and tie to the court house
Look the judge in the eye like man
Not dove , not lamb , not slave , or church mouse
You king , you god , you holy El
Get out this hole and give these motherfuckers holy hell
So over time , perfected my rhymes and
Thats why shine like climbed out the Holy Grail
Mainstream dropout , white widow cotton mouth
Out in Queens Park with crew of dirty stopouts
London bridge is falling down
The Bullitts lickin shots on the Parliament grounds
Every devil , every scoundrel , every henchmen , every hound
Get lassoed by the sound
Ran across the desert , then shackled to the mound

Im not sure anymore , more
Who is knocking at my door , door
All the faces that know
Ja make them so sunny and true

dont wanna say goodbye , to you
So Ill just say good night , to you
My people , no goodbyes to you
Imma just say good night

Right now can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like could relive it
Me and my grandparents on field trip
And Im the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But itll fade before get to get hold of that
Man wish could stop time like photograph
Every joke that they told Id know to laugh
Man ( man ) , wouldnt let moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you dont really know cause you cant recall them
Its sorta fly you get chance to say hi to
People you never got chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life ( real life ) , if you try to
So close ( so close ) , but so far ( so far )
And so far ( so far ) , no cigar ( no cigar )
We cant dwell on the past all we got is today
So Imma live like its no tomorrow
No goodbyes


Uh , to you
If part , my art will live through you
Dream beautiful , and unusual
Wake up like everyday new to you
Stay true to you , hood musical
My art will live through you
Dream beautiful and unusual
Wake up like everyday new to you
Stay true to you , hood musical


Im not sure anymore , more
Who is knocking at my door , door
All the faces that know
Ja make them so sunny and true

God make the world get up and move

We are , we are , the grand groove , grand groove
God make the world get up and move
God Allah make world the get up and move

Yo check
All praise due to the merciful and beneficent
Sovereign universal dominate black element
Thats the space , ancient like Sanskrit
Even though man made transmit my transcripts
And they cant be tamped with
Allah protect this
make jams for crime clans and working class fams
And all yall mans who eat aci with chams
And heads in the flats who dispatch the dollar vans
Young kids in badlands with great escape plans
Who eat most of they meals outta boxes and cans
Casualties and cutbacks of social programs
Dedicated
To all those who rode slave ships
Who screamed and cried but survived the ride
know that my life is better cause you weathered the tide
Harder work on this side making truth magnify
Devils cant stop me , but they damn sure try
Shine the light on the Earth that receive and radiate
Aint no surface Ive seen thats too dense to penetrate
There are plans by many hands to make us deviate
So speak on plates so that all good life regenerate
Baby aint no time to deliberate
He put the wonder in the world lets activate
Lets activate , lets activate , lets activate
Cause



You know aint gotta lie to you
God made the world get up and move
You know aint gotta lie to you
God Allah made the world get up its true
You know aint gotta lie to you

Yes you know aint gotta lie to you
God Allah made the world , Allah made it all
Allah made the world , Allah made it all
Allah made the world , Allah makes it all
Allah made the world , Allah controls it all
Allah makes the world , Allah controls it all
Allah made the world , Allah controls it all
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Oh this takes me home
It makes me think about sitting outside of my old home when was younger and singing something like

( KNaan in Somali )
Gabaryaray shuxaano
Maro Shabeel eh xirato
Maro qafiif eh huwato
Magacaaga ii sheeg
Magacayga waa Sharaf
Sharaf , Xaaji weyaan
Aqalada xiriirta
Dhinac baa ka jooga
Ala yaa usheega ?
Tinta ushaleeya ?
Sabaax nuurey
Adoo kilkiley
Iyo
Kaloon badanay
Adoo xajka jira
Xasuus badhanay !
Saxiibtaa
Caasho , cashaq baa dhilay
Ugu dhambaystina
Aniga iyo geel uba
Ugu banaan bixin
Waa aniga orodneey
Nabad dheynee
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey

There are certain things fresh and certain things mish
got my own sound dont sound like the rest
And even my attire and my choice of dress
And not long ago dont spoke English
My point is police pull me over lot
They wonder what kind of rap sheet got
And sometimes take young girl out to eat
And hold the door open , " Oh , youre so sweet ! "
Of course my affections super illustrated
And like to give dont reciprocate it
Unless you could give me someone innovated
Well lets cook it up we dont refrigerate it
But back to the country of the educated
Where people get robbed and they celebrate it

Waa aniga orodneey
Nabad dheynee !
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey
Mareekan waa laga soo waayey

Maraken , my country tis of thee
Sweet land for robberies
Fat and frills , thrills and spills
Eat and sleep , hump and kill
Shop til you drop , work til you dead
Get all you can , then get in the wind
Outta my face on your knees
Sleep in the mansion , shut out the streets
Make that cake , whoop that trick
Lick my swagger suck my sick
Get high get low get stcky get rich
Get yo own show get down get quick
You slow you blow you broke your fix
Terror dome , home swag home
Terror dome , home swag home
Home swag home , home swag home

( Somalian ( America ) )

There are some things pure while certain things blur
Dilute it with the lie and you believe when it occur
Falsified information got my people in the stir
We have to be in search of something equal to the cure
Straight out the door , come to give you more
Lay the law keep it raw , when speak it from the core
Get underneath your skin like especially with the claw
Conflicted with the rich cuz kick it with the poor
laugh in the face of adversity
Sound clashed with the bass cuz its natural to me
But if you pay attention to the past you will see
Not long ago you black theyd hang your ass from tree
Certain things things change , while some stay the same
Some are recluse others are lovers of the game
Im trying to walk the lane , the Sirat al-Mustaqim
Instead of doing things they keep you covered in the flame

( Somali )
Nanananana that shit was cool in English , but let me get that Somali verse

An Open Letter From Mos Def
By Mos Def
February 1999

An Open letter From Mos Def . . .
Diallo was West African immigrant with no prior criminal record who was shot and killed by police in the dark of night for simply being black . He was unarmed and shot at 41 times ! No unarmed man should be shot at even once ! One of the police officers involved in the Diallo shooting was involved in the killing of Patrick Bailey no more than year and half ago ! Tyesha Miller was shot in her car in Los Angeles while she had seizure ! could go on and on with the names of black people who have been killed at the hands of police just this year . But the list is so long that it would turn this letter into statistic sheet .

Most of the people that got killed by police this year and in the past have probably been some of your fans ; fans of some of your favorite artists . They are black people who love us , who defend us , who protect us , who put us in our comfortable homes an dour luxury sports utility vehicles and our well kept hotels suites and our oversized tour buses . Theyre the people that buy our records , our t-shirts , our concert tickets , and so on , and so forth . Theyre the same people that are getting murdered , harassed , maimed , and beaten in streets all over the world everyday !

The only people in our community who have not responded to this incident are us . Hip-Hop made one hundred billion dollars last year ! . . . lot of those dollars came from the Comptoms , the Brooklyns , the Crown Heights , the Chicagos , the Detroit ghettos , the St . Louis ghettos . . . the same ghettos where police run around literally hunting black folks to murder . . . then cruise the streets shortly thereafter with impunity and arrogance .

We are the Senators and the Congressmen of our communities . We come from communities that dont have nobody to speak for them . Thats why they love us . Because we talk about what nobody else will talk about . We represent them . And they need to know that we really represent them . Not when its just romantic notion or paycheck attached to it . When something happens to them it matters to us , because when something happens to them its happening to us . Because Amadou Diallo is your brother , your cousin , your man . . . Tyesha Miller is your sister , your aunt , your girl , your wife , your daughter . . . All of these people are you ! You are no different ! And just because were at the top of the Billboard charts , seen on MTV daily , livin comfortably doesnt mean that we cant get shot , we cant be harassed , we cant be maimed and mistreated .

hope this is as important to you as it is to me cause when pass by the projects and when pass by the hood dont see nobody but me . see everybody who looks like me . see me many years ago as Im sure many of you do . So its time for us to come together from the jiggy to the hardcore ; from the backpacker to the man with the Lexus and really unite and show the world that we got strength . Show the world who we are . Represent who we are . Who we really are and where we really come from . Lets show people where our heart is . . . that we havent forgotten .

Now Im askin you and anybody who looks on this letter to come forward and show your heart , to show your love , to love the people who love you back by speaking out against the injustices that they suffer . Because believe me , if the clock was turned backwards wed be those same people .

Please stay mindful of this . Please be considerate of this letter . Pass it around ! Talk about this ! Think about it ! Keep it on your mind because if you dont . . . its going to keep its mind on you .

wanna thank everybody for taking time out to read this letter . hope didnt take up too much of your time . All of the contact information and other information you need to know is enclosed .

want to wish everybody , each and everyone of yall peace , prosperity and love .

Peace ,
Mos Def
Yo , this is 88
This is for Amadou Diallo
Rest in peace , you still here

Yo , Im in brownstone singin like Brownstone
Birds eye view of the bodega
No Omega like Rakim
Thinkin about brother Diallo
find it hard to swallow
Cause 41 is hard act to follow
Who is it , it can happen tomorrow
Goes down all the time in some African community
This one just hit closer to home
Cause it happened in our backyard
This that * shit * bring us closer to home
They ask " What you writin fo ? What you writin on that paper fo ? "
Dont ask me nothing , just tell me
Who Howard Safir got it safer for , thats why my raps sour
My peoples screamin " Black power ! " and " La Raza ! "
From the Bronx , police bustin , its redemption time

Now on the squad car , CPRs supposed to be the motto
But in they minds , they be like " Yo , Ima do Diallo "
guess masters noose was bitter pill to swallow
Cause nowadays , tips aint the only things thats hollow
Constitution , 41 more holes in it
And cops swingin sticks like they tryin to win the pennant
And stickin sticks places where they ashamed to admit it
But thats the straw that broke the camels back
THEY GON GET IT ! !

Possessed by nervous twitch and itchy writing finger
41 strokes through the barrel of pen for Amadou
More than few of my personal friends
Since the beginning , it seems like it never ends
The story , ancient as biblical allegory and its all gory
The Little Shop of City Hall Horrors
Who bakes infiltrate , agent , provocateur mission statement
Assassinate the Senate candidate , heavenly mandate

We proceeded on country road
His mothers eyes withered swoll
Her child was never comin home
Said prayer for his soul
As the coffin had closed , committed to the earth below
First seed she had sewn , would be tree never grown
Shade that was never known
Who controls the Terrordome , the men with hearts made of stone
Who love only what they own

Stay on your toes for troop whose description match
Blue suits , walkin round wit stick and * edit *
Ready to blast with the wrath of hollow tip
And the fact is my taxes are scholarship
feel it in my chest cavity
The only deaths apathy , so change it for whos next after me
And thats the fullest reward
Keep the face of the lost on my bulletin board

Yo yo , its blue uniform , sirens , names , and badge numbers
Clubs , walkie-talkies , recipes for bad summers
Frisked , pissed after tuck in my stuff
really think they just like touchin my * nuts *
Whats real stain they thoughts
Swear , but they wont say it in court
All they do is change the report
Riots , tryin to keep the crowd in control
They even got shows , Cops , LAPD , Highway Patrol yo yo

From the cradle to the grave , they made you slave
Brainwashed to kill each other , thats the plague that they made
search em like readin scripts that could save you today
White is right , black is wrong , thats the label they gave
Fryin in hell , applyin jails , they got you dyin in cells
Triple six in the mix , Levine to ? spell ?
Prepare for the worst , and try to hope for the best
take stare at the hearse , can we cope wit the stress ?

See live in the land of plungers
Illegal chokeholds and excessive gunshots
Where theres one millionaire for every million empty pot
And Adolf Guili think we static but hes in for shock
They come wit automatics but we flip it
Use the one , create the four Glocks and while stocks get washed
While school doors get locked and when jobs get blocked
The confi-dence gets rock
And when the welfares drop into the jails we stock now
After Amadou wrestlin wit freedom tacks my mind into headlock
But * fuck * & , Im true cat
Refundin power back to our Blocks


Good life , you can bubble or struggle
But use your brain muscle if you hustle
Dont let nobody touch you
Dont even trust the ones that trust you
Cause the ones you showin love to might bust you
Seekin as cancer , my man got shot by Haitians or Jamaicans
Confrontations and school my minds racin
pride these sensations over this , now Im hopin this
We shine for , never got chance to rhyme for
My role models sold bottles and stole cars
And when they got locked , accepted all the phone calls
Thats when * niggas * was real
Back before had deal
Back when people called Villsburg Hooterville
ILL ! ! !

My mind wonders on melodic jams
An exotic bird , caged with the rage and the violence of my words
The same things down turn around and do
The white cops say nigga , but say nigga too
Truth be told we hypocrites
In materialistic society , spirituality shunned or
While young kinds get gunned on
Hibernatin in projects , which you project-ing
The pigs is crucifyin but Africans is resurrectin , Jane Doe

Pataki , sending cops to come and catch me
He better send running back to run track meet
When Im running through the back streets
The rat teeth of beast loving the black meat
Eatin brothers like our pigment color is that sweet
To lock man up in prison , the standard of living
Thinking they make better brand of man
Than the man when he went in
Rub up man for sinnin
Handcuff his hands to the system , banned from his wisdom
With insanity in him , his mind roams like cyclone
Damagin victim , his eyes hold savage within him
Wrath with the venom , poison his life
No ointment to boisten the might
If its on the left , walk to the right
Until death , do your part through your life
Like boyfriend and wife , because the day times shorter than night
You know ?


Yo , black is fragile remember that
Cherish everyday
Live life to the fullest , aight ?
The way feel , sometimes its too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate , times are so real
Sometimes try and chill , mellow down , blowin smoke
Smile on my face but its really no joke
You feel it in the streets , people breathe without hope
They goin through the motion , they dimmin down their focus
The focus gettin clear and the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary , the mind grow weary
speak it so clearly sometimes you dont hear me
push it past the bass , know nations gotta feel me
feel it in my bones , black Im so wide awake
That hardly ever sleep , my flows forever deep
And its volumes or scriptures when breathe on beat
My presence speak volumes before say word
Im everywhere : penthouse , pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave , tall cathedral of shell
Universal ghetto life , holla black you know it well
Quiet storm , vital form , pen pushed it right across
Mind is vital force , high level right across
Soul is the lions roar , voice is the siren
swing round , ring out and bring down the tyrant
Shocked small act could knock giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous , theres no need for fightin
Suckas trying to hide like the struggle wont find em
And the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him
Everywhere penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave , talkll lead you on shell
Universal ghetto life , holla black you know it well

What it is , you know , they know
What it is , we know , yall know
What it is , Ecstatic , there it is
What it is , you know , we know
What it is , they know , yall know
What it is , you dont know ? Here it is

And always on time and rockin ya mind

Sit and come relax , riddle off the mac
Its the patch , Im soldier in the middle of Iraq
Well say about noonish , comin out the whip
And lookin at me curious , young Iraqi kid
Carrying laundry , " Whats wrong ? Hungry ? "
" No , gimme my oil or get [ fuck ] out my country "
And in Arabian barkin other stuff
til his moms come grab him and they walk off in rush
Distrust , feeling like Ive pissed upon wound
Im like , " Surely hope that we can fix our differences soon ! " Bye !
Buying apples Im breakin on
You take everything , why not just take the damn food , black monster ? Like dont understand it , on another planet
15 month of this stuff , how Im gonna manage ?
And increasing the sentiment , gentlemen
Getting down on their middle eastern instruments
Realized trapped in this crowd
Walk over kicked one of my fabulous raps ( la dee da dee )
Arab jaw drop , they well wish , they glad rap
Now the kid considered like an Elvis of Baghdad

Omar : Men have two faces : one that laughs and one that cries
Ali : They sent you ?
Omar : Yeah , so ? Here

Yeah
What it look like ?
Mad Skillz
Mr . Eon ( the mighty Mos Def )
Mighty Mos ( the . . Rawkus connection )
Coast to coast ( from 88 to 99 )
What what what what

Its on fire tonight
Everything on my side is looking alright
Its the high power original , b-boy traditional
Raw bass material , Brooklyn individual
True brand imperial youre hearing on your stereo
Transcribe the live , the Mos Def initial
Sit back and listen , you aint in no position
To deal with my conditional mentally and physical
Strength is indivisible , crews be coming pitiful
Speech be sound typical , downfall habitual
Ock , Im not feeling you !
Dont know what your label telling you
Or what magic beans they selling you
can flow , you cant though , example
Of cat who just modern day Sambo ( yeah )
Who be bitching out to & demands so
You can collect your little petty cash advance ho
You knock-kneed and sloppy , but not me
Im I-N , E-P , N-D E-N

It was jam at the center and the party was shaking
And the poppers was popping and the breakers was breaking
And it wont be long til everybody know that
B-boys rock the document

Yo , yo , you on the injured , Im hot to death
Im foul , plus Im winning , you think shot the ref ?
Rock vest if you out of tone speaking
Cause Im right there like nightmares , catch MCs while they sleeping
Im back , these rap cats is wilding
Got em in the studio poppin valiums , remastering they album
Im about to re-up and restructure the case
You stuck , you about to get rearranged and replaced
got plans for this rap game
Put your head in the toilet and look son
If you think my shit done changed
My shit is out of your range , rip you out of your frame
Cop your tape , and the next day , copped an exchange
If you aint rocking raw , what you rocking for ?
Without heat , yall MCs aint hot no more
So for you lame cats trying to put your hit out
Try rocking back and forth
It might be easier to get your shit out !


Im Jedi Master , Mace Windu , what you been through
Keep MCs heads wrapped like Erykah Badu
Hip-Hops Cleon Jones , when Eon Jones
Wackest MCs , we pee on those
No need to impede The High and Mighty mystique
That shit would be as ignorant as Jimmy the Greek
Claiming they Godzillas when they really Godzooki
Got mill from Charlie Brown when kidnapped Snoopy
Eon , sale or performance , in any ordinance
Rhyme menace , that burst your verbal nuisance
In accordance , with all the laws from the cordless
Starbuck coming through , leaving any pimp whoreless
Stereo stomping
Defeating me is like Latrell choking up John Thompson
Charles Bronson had Death Wish for this next to left shit
Leaving all these hot air MCs breathless


said b-boys rock the document ( . . ument . . ument * echoes * )

* DJ scratches " b-boy , document " *

Beef is not what Jay said to Nas
Beef is when the working folks cant find jobs
So they trying to find niggas to rob
Trying to find bigger guns so they can finish the job
Beef is when the crack babies cant find moms
Cause they in pine box , or locked behind bars
Beef aint the summer jam for Hot 9-7
Beef is the cocaine and AIDS epidemic
Beef dont come with radio edit
Beef is when the judge is callin you defendant
Beef : It come with long jail sentence
Handed down to you in few short minutes
Beef is when your girl come through for visit
To tell you that she pregnant , by some other nigga
Beef is high blood pressure and bad credit
Need loan for your home but youre too broke to get it
And all your little kids is doing is getting bigger
Youre trying not to raise em around these wild niggas
Beef is when gold digger got your seed in her
manicure handout like , " Pay me nigga ! "
Or Im telling your wife
Or starting up some foul rumor thatll ruin your life
Beef is when gangsta aint doing it right
And other gangstas is deciding what to do with his life
Beef is not what these famous niggas do on the mic
Beef is what George Bush would do in fight
Beef is what Ja said to 50
But beef is all my homies not being here with me
When soldier ends his life with his own gun
Beef is trying to figure out what to tell his son
Beef is oil prices and geopolitics
Beef is Iraq , the West Bank and Gaza Strip
Some beef is big and some beef is small
But what yall call beef is not beef at all
Beef is real life happening every day
And its realer than them songs you gave to Kayslay
This has been real niggas . .
From Mos Def pretty flaco
Black Dante
And the Black Star Embassy to the !
For sinners , saints and scramblers and gamblers
And dirty money handlers , dignitaries and champions , narcotic traffickers
Talented number runners and racketeers
Stars of stage , page and cameras , slang swingers and swaggerers
Double barrels and Derringers , automatics and miracles
Europe Asia and Africa , all the time in America

The livest high flyingest pilot bombardier from Pyrrhus
Stationed live and direct , Medina mastermind set
Ya cant lock my set now lock off , cool
Peace to the nation of the Gods and the Earths
And the Sun , Moon & Stars , furthermore born knowledge go hard

Remix , rising up out of the flames like phoenix
Strainin to carry the weight of my brain like genius
Knowin Im sowin them seeds
Lets see whose thumb is the greenest
If said it mean it
And did it because need it
Eat sleep it and bleed it
Write it down and then read it
Asphalt to the cement
Your trash talk is deleted
Blastoff , lay them out like Tempurpedic
Black Thought , told you Ima win eventually
This unsung , underrated , under appreciated
The one them underachievers had underestimated
Finally graduated from something thats so hated
To one of the most sacred , nobody gonna take it
Face it , keep doing it well
Doin it sans assistance
Is do it yourself , doin it below the radar
We doin it stealth , doing it again
For Illadelph and who else ? But check it out
Yall see him on job , see my eyes focused where the prize be
Im like Martin Luther King you like Rodney
The difference is give it everything inside me
Dear Diary , my fans still swear by me
Even though Im late night now like heres Johnny
Swimming with them great whites now is where youll find me
Funny how it break right down but never mind me
Im forever grimy , guess its just Philly shining
Rock rolla bi-polar like Phyllis Hyman

Like dope fiend opening up bottle of dopamine
Youre just hoping you dont get roped for your throat get choked anything
Oh and just think how dope he could be if he smoked anything
Oh , there goes the bell , the sound of the opening ding
hit you as hard as barbiturates in the ribs with switch
And stitch you at the same time before you can flinch to it
My dick is so big , if add another inch to it
You would swear when raped you that you was actually into it
Im not baller but you can bet your fuckin bottom dollar
That remember when was without dollar bill in my wallet
Now watch me kill koala while maul chihuahua
Bum pill off of Paula like let me holler at you , mama
Its like Im off the bombom when bring the fuckin drama
Used to bomb ya like Saddam but now that Im little calmer
Im fuckin cross between Osama , Dahmer , Obama , and Dalai Lama
So Miley Im knight in shining armor
Mail gift to Taylor Swifts trailer picture
Of my genitalia with note saying " bitch , cant wait to nail ya "
Drug paraphernalia beware the werewolf will kill ya
Thats him in the sheeps clothes ; he just shaved his hair off Cecilia

The De Las gonna do the body good like wheat bread

Shakin laces out of shoes , Mos Def brought the brews
Sittin indian squats to make that bread tie knots
See Im out to get the coin like in them rainbow pots
Swingin life like hammock , invested like stocks

Through your sinus complex , aims to clog it up
Slappin fives with pain is crew here to gain
We remain on your mind like skulls
Not dull moment shown
When in the house all perimeters are blown

Native Tongue come through to make you say yes yes
This is the mighty Mos Def style fresh like baby breath

We are the killer combination with the size to administer
The beatdown to swell up all three of your eyes

Now this goes out to all area cliques
Centralized or way out in the sticks

No tricks in ninety-six , Native Tongue gon build
But we be easy on the cut , no mistakes allowed
Cause to me , MC mean , makin cream
When speak on groups and Im smooth like gabardine
Tryin to hang out with Dove and catch love in Aberdeen ( word up )
bag dimes like my man born on August 17
Life be nuttin but river son Im swimmin upstream

Playin wait up , with the data servin your ears
With information due to confirmation of the nations most
Wicked ways of livin , like them glassy eyed beans
Inhale the smoke of fiends , while bangin the tape
Rated at the high point of the mass
Rippin MCs at the top of class , occasionally
Rippin some suckers face
Or some suckable ass from girl
Its big brother beat for the wide wide world

Im makin memos off these demos back in eighty-nine
Took you all on encounters of an unknown kind ( right )
Did the hustle with couple of us , but soon noted
That my niggas buttered Benedict rolls , and then voted
wrote in the dark so could feel it like braille ( uh-huh )
Heard the big brother beat , got locked with no bail
Came to set it like equators invented , with the heat
Yo Mos Def how you radiate to make it complete

Manifestin for the future here in the present tense

Word up
Man you hear this bullshit they be talking
Every day , man
Its like these motherfuckers is just like professional liars
You know what Im sayin
Its wild
Listen

Bin Laden didnt blow up the projects
It was you , nigga
Tell the truth , nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth , nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth , nigga

pledge no allegiance
Nigga , fuck the Presidents speeches
Im baptized by America and covered in leeches
The dirty water that bleaches your soul and your facial features
Drowning you in propaganda that they spit through the speakers
And if you speak about the evil that the government does
The Patriot Act will track you to the type of your blood
They try to frame you
And say you was trying sell drugs
And throw federal indictment on niggas to show you love
This shit is run by fake Christians
Fake politicians
Look at they mansions
Then look at the conditions you live in
All they talk about is terrorism on television
They tell you to listen
But they dont really tell you they mission
They funded Al-Qaeda and now they blame the Muslim religion
Even though Bin Laden was CIA tactician
They gave him billions of dollars and they funded his purpose
Fahrenheit / 11
Thats just scratching the surface


They say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam
But thats bullshit
Ill show you why its totally wrong
Cuz if another country invaded the hood tonight
Itd be warfare through Harlem
And Washington Heights
wouldnt be fighting for Bush or White Americas dream
Id be fighting for my peoples survival and self-esteem
wouldnt fight for racist churches from the South , my nigga
Id be fighting to keep the occupation out , my nigga
You ever clock someone who talk shit , or look at you wrong
Imagine if they shot at you
And was raping your moms
And of course Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons
We sold him that shit
After Ronald Reagans election
Mercenary contractors fighting new era
Corporate military banking off the war on terror
They controlling the ghetto with the fear of attack
Tryna distract the fact that they engineering the crack
So Im strapped like Lee Malvo holding sniper rifle
These bullets will touch your kids and dont mean like Michael
Your body be sent to the morgue
Stripped down and recycled
fire on house niggas that support you and like you
Cuz innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily
And poor people never get shit and struggle daily
This aint no alien conspiracy theory
This shit is real
Written on the dollar underneath the Masonic seal

dont rap for dead presidents
Id rather see the President dead
Its never been said but set precedents )


Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Let the choir sing

Everywhere we go
People wanna know
Who we are
So we tell them

Operating in the dark
Surgery your wounded heart
Come together peel apart
Peel apart come together
Smoking on something good
Praying for something better

Never rocking for forever ever
Ever ever ever ever
Forever ever ever ever

Its still secret even when you tell em dumb dummies
Hush money , rent receipt and drug money
They cold gutter , want gun money
The chief rocker , fuel-injected Zulu horse proper , love boogie

Shining you crying to fight them back

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah [ repeat ]
But keep forgetting
Played my part
5000 hours , rewritting Power
Over and over
Some nights sober , some nights gone off the Henny as usual
So unusual to be in this position
Everybody playin him , truth be told
The last nigga ever let the truth be told
And oh Mos Def ran to my home
And said they gon have yo ass gone
Light jokes , you keep playin with them white folks
Cant even take the piss
Cut all the sponsorship for the touring !
dont know , ask , ask Hennesy ( thats Coca-Cola )
But rappers aint mean enough ?
Enough lashes like aint seen enough
On the real , this is like the neo-Emmitt Till
Whistling , get yo fuckin ass killed
Lets keep this shit real !
Now who the realest
Everybody feel this
And everyday of my life , people try to tell me that hate the whites
Cause said whats right
go to sleep and deal wit it every night
And wake up every morning
And walk to the liquor store or coffee store shop on the Mersa whats worser ?
Its no verse that would reverse the
In print or in cursive
They curse the name , or maybe call me Kane
Black people wanna talk about me on blogs
Cause like clothes like , look at this fag
Thats what have to deal wit real shit
Yall dont even understand , what it take to be real man
For many years , these aint rhymes these is muthaf-cking tears
From my last breath
They kicked me out the awards and my nigga Diddy left
Then they even sent Beyonce up to give the Award back
And she rode the wave as rode the slave
As felt like slave as they try to put my shit up in the grave
Nigga behave , nigga behave
Be the first one
And get up and just perform , Shit is enormous
Cause everybody know that Dark Fantasy was the highest rated album in history
So just avoided it , not to be exploited , not to be recorded
Cause cannot afford it , cannot afford more shit to be impor-ted
How feel to be black man , you say something wrong , nobody understand
Money , power , black , opinion , pick two , they would kill ya

No matter what goes on
They may not agree , they may not understand
But God got plan , to put the mic in my hand
And his hand and that hand
And ideas , and all of theres
And the end , everybody up in here , in this atmosphere
So make it clear , live long and prosper
Much success , even if you wish me the opposite
To quote Nas , stay on my job
Try to pray to keep my heart from going harm
And aint perfect , you know that from old me
buried my Grandmother on Thursday , two weeks ago
My life is real , as it ever been
To all my friends and even foes
Each and every one of those , let em know
shine globe , even in the dark , stay smart
Stay sharp , as harp played by musician in this position
Feel blessed to make the whole World listen
And just glisten without even trying
Even when die , wont stay dead
And its straight off the head , and its straight out the lungs
Looking fly , fresh , old man , so young
This thing ups , let us all give some
And make the whole world aware of it
Brooklyn in the building we take care of it
Peace out to all the Sagittarius
And happy birthday Pisces and Aries too
And this go out to all area crew
And if you come from the seven-eighteen then you just like me
From the present , and the past and the future and beyond
Me and Lupe and Kanye we play the song and get it on

While you staring down my throat like , " Is he drunk or is he sober ? "
Who knows ? ! All know is Tash got flows
And got the technique to get the ladies out of they clothes

They braincells fryin slowly ( FIRE ! ) so slowly flow and
Express written consent , from the undergroundin niggas
Coast II Coast represent cause gettin bent , do
But Im doper than sherm plus the way put it down
Could burn the perm off Big Worm , so peep this private screening
Of the Last Action Hero that be freezin rappers dead in they tracks
Like Sub Zero ( Zero ) , cause Rico aint no joke
eat yo flows and yo beat up rappers even feel my presence
When Im home with my feet up

Yo what you skied up or treed up ?
Relax and pull seat up , make your landlord turn the heat up
Got the opposition shook like Tiger Woods about to tee up
So niggas no competition with the clear Mos Definition
MCs screamin now for years cant rhyme without they moms permission
You just youngun comin out , gettin gassed to run your mouth
Wildin on the Runabout , Baby Pah you comin out
Barkin that you want bout but son you know the comeabout
When Mos Def blow up and , you dont , nuttin
Dont you know nuttin ? My crew go huntin
We keep it on the norm then we transform somin
And while , we do it , you bounce to it
The cops wanna stop the Body Rock but dont do it

Matta fact tell the coaches , the GMs , and owners
Shut down the stadiums , its over

Get the comp choked up like white folks on Oprah
Yeah you dope , but ( CAV ) its more doper
More skill , more style , and more focus
hit the lab with good shit to smoke up
And tell the sound man where wanna go from
Blow up , skit sheet across the notepad
School em all from the drop out to post grads
What history book you do or dont have
Theres only two eras of rap , pre and post CAV
Now you know that
Stop the train , theres no place for the game left to go at

Cavee is my name but you can call me , ( CAV )
Its all the same abbreviated or whole
Shout it out so it dont be secret to folk it go , ( CAV )
Short for Cavee but Im not from Cali
Im from the rotten apple , dirty streets and alleys
Bed-Stuy Brooklyn doin it exactly , Get at me ! ! !

Holla ! ! . . . Like Missy and Ja Rule
Aint crowd in the world that CAV cannot move
Hot dude , cats was thinkin its not true
But come front row at the show , got proof

To servin spoony for the fiends to gnaw to
Got sent upstate on bus , ( Not cool )
In the yard thinkin damn shouldve listen to ma duke
Come home in 99 , what the fuck Im gonna do

Buildin up my rep to be one of the five greatest
And aint saying CAV the best nigga out there
But until he appear , Im sittin in his chair
And Imma need few moments just to get in yall ear
To make you forget that dude was ever even here
got two words for the world : Be prepared
got three words for your girl : Dont be scared !
And when they ask where the real hip-hop , ITS OVER HERE !
And when they ask where Brooklyn at , HOLD YA EARS !

Depressing , pathetic , please forget it
Youre mad cause my style youre admiring

Time for new flava in ya ear
Im kicking new flava in ya ear
Macks brand new flava in ya ear

Word up , no rap no crap you bore me
Wanna grab my dick , too lazy , hold it for me
Im straight rap great
Busting heads , straighten dreads
Im everlasting , like the toe on Pro Keds
Tec-9 when rhyme
Plus climb , word is bond
Your album couldnt fuck with one line
Its been three years since you last hear
But now reappear your heart pumps fear
To your gut , did your girls butt

step on stage , girls scream like Im Keith
You wont be around next year
My raps too severe , kicking mad flava in ya ear


Twenty-one ninety-four
Mad motherfucking hardcore
Its my time to burn now explore
The flava in ya ear its the boy scout
make outs , make other rappers have doubts
Youre fucking with the wrong clan
And the wrong man , thats it
Now you got to get your dome split
Im going into my knapsack with my gat
Take off my hat , yes Im just cool like dat
The dangerous , the ruggedness , from the Flatbush abyss
BLS 97 KISS bounce to this
Im gonna live long in this rap game , niggas know my name
Yo Puffy

Burn em in the flames

Youre jingling baby ( go head daddy )
Youre jingling baby ( go head daddy )

Hee-shee , uh blowticious
Skeevee , delicious
Gimme couscous , love me good
Um damn , Hollis to Hollywood , but is he good
guess like the jeans uh
Flavor like Praline , sick daddy nahmean
Papa love it , when he does it
Niggas buzz it
But tell me was it really just the flavor that be clogging your ears
The most healthy behavior is to stay in the clear
Its all for you , its really all for you
( Now what )
Hunchback , close your eyes try to munch that
Coil up your ankles let your Timbs tap
Bite the flavor it reacts to your gold caps
Word to Mama , tongue kiss piranha
Electrocute barracuda , Im here to bring the drama

Yo ! Yo ! Yo !
Flavors in your ass crease ha
Busta Rhymes about to bring the noise dont cease ha
Let me loose from the belly of the beast ha
Everybody , hey hey hey
You better believe its Busta Rhymes the great
We bout to rip the Tri-State
Yo yo , hey hey hey
Ill split your face and give you stitches
Throw niggas in ditches , slap the ass of fat bitches
Wait one sec , as get down
Im rolling with the heavyweight connect to the stomping ground
Now , dont you get suspicious
grant your wishes every time
Bring it vicious when bust rhyme
know one thing the whole world least expected is how we all connected
To break fool on the same record
Five new flavors on beat , feel the fucking heat
really think you should retreat while we blow up the street
Instead of copping pleas just freeze
Maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees
When get down disappear , reappear and blow up
Everywhere , fucking with these flavas in ya ear

Im here to make dollar out of 15 cents
And let my balls hang like Im on toilet taking shit
My style is all that and big bag of chips with the dip
Fuck all that sensuous shit
represent intellectual violence
And leave your clique holier than the 10 Commandments
Like Redman shift with the ruck
If your if was spliff wed be all fucked up ( Word up )
No need to ask you who is he , son get busy
Scuff my Timbs on the boulevard of many ruff cities
( Chicago , LA , any of em ) Ill have to Norman Bate you
love ta hate you cause youse freak by nature
Cant wait to face you , mutilate you
Drink your style down straight with no chaser
My verbal combats like mini-Mac to your back
As soon as one of you niggas try to over react
The . . . love good confrontation or vamp
Break your concentration , murder your camp
For tha jealous , overzealous , we fellas
Blow the the spot like Branford Marsalis
Niggas coming through and acting wild
Yall commercial niggas better have coke and smile , shot you

conversate with many men , its time to begin again
Forgot what already knew , ayo , you hear me friend
Illuminati want my mind , soul and my body
Secret society , trying to keep they eye on me
But Im stay incogni , in places they cant find me
Make my moves strategically , the . .
Its sorta similar but iller than chess player
use my thinker , it coincides with my blinker
While you wondered what we saying on the records real
Yeah , you mothafuckin right kid you know the deal
My Mobb is Infamous just like the fuckin title read
You get back slapped so hard make ya nose bleed
Some [ def ] kids feeling guilty bout the [ space shit ]
The truth hurts baby girl so just face it ( Alright )
But anyway , back on the real side of things
My niggas sling cracks and wear fat diamond rings
Not only is it inside the songs that we sing
Everything is real not just song that we sing
From my life to the paper , very accurately
Give you all of my two so maybe you can three
Prodigy will forever will S-H I-N
My shit attract millions like the moon attract the sea
How dare you ever in your life walk past me
Without acknowledging this man as G-O , shot you faggot ass

Now who the fuck you think you talking to , pay dues spray crews
Look Im Joey Crack , motherfuckers be like hes bad news
Runnin this racket , from New York to Montego
Slaughtering people , bring ton of keys from Puerto Rico
Id rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer
These bitch-ass niggas know we stronger
Than these weaklings , seeking for respect that aint there
Knuckleheads beware theres mad tension in the air
Tommy guns for fun shotties for block parties
While fresh lead heats up your insides like fifth of Bacardi
Call the ambulance , this mans wet
Bullets cut him down from the root up just like Gillette
Razor , which keep hidden in my oral
Ready to spatter at any ad out that wants to quarrel
These feds want me for some tax evasion
Mad at the fact that somebodys getting lucci thats not caucasian
Bullets be blazing through these streets filled with torture
Joey Crack . . . Keyser Soze

Thug niggas give they minks to chinks to down
We sip drinks rockin minks , flashing rings and things ( What the deal )
Fronting hardcore deep inside the Jeep , mackin
Doing my thing fly nigga you Scarface king
Bitches grab ya ta-tas , get them niggas for they chedda
Fuck it , Gucci sweaters and Armani leathers
Flossing rocks like the size of Fort Knox
Four carats , the ice rocks , pussy banging like Versace locs pops
Want ta the creep , on the light raw ass cheeks
Im sexing raw dog without protection , diseaese infested
Italiano got the Lucciano
gets down fucking with Brown Fox extra keys to the drop
Boo Im Jingling Baby
got crazy Dominicans who pay me to lay low , play slow
Roll with The Firm , Mafiaso crime king pin
It all real nigga what tha deal , shot you

What the fuck , thought conquered the whole world
Crushed Moe Dee , Hammer and Ice-Ts girl
But still , niggas want to instigate shit
Ill battle any nigga in tha rap game quick
Name the spot , make it hot for you bitches
Female rappers too , dont give fuck boo
Word , Im here to crush all my peers
Rhymes of the month in The Source for twenty years
Niggas scared , Im detrimental to your mental state
use my presidential Rolex to be the bait
Niggas fight , Glock cocked ya temple gets fucked
MCs , that fuck with LL they gets bucked
Thats real , whats up with that Shot Ya deal
Light shit , niggas slip now how the bullet feel
New York appeal , in . . they gang bang
But if you touch mic your motherfuckin ass hang
Thats facts , niggas dont recieve no type of slack
Cause if they do , they ass is always runnin back
Not this time , but next time Imma name names
LL , shitting from on top of the game , shot you
Cmon man

And with the local DBT news , LL Cool with triumphant comeback
But tonight

Dont call it comeback , been here for years
Rocking my peers and putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like mon-SOON
Listen to the bass go BOOM
Explosion , overpowering
Over the competition , Im towering
Wrecking shop , when drop these lyrics thatll make you call the cops
Dont you dare stare , you betta move
Dont ever compare
Me to the rest thatll all get sliced and diced
Competitions paying the price

Im gonna knock you out [ HUUUH ! ! ! ]
Mama said knock you out [ HUUUH ! ! ! ]

Dont you call this regular jam
Im gonna rock this land
Im gonna take this itty bitty world by storm
And Im just getting warm
Just like Muhummad Ali they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like skull
Cause you know had beef wit
Why do you riff with me , the maniac psycho
And when pull out my jammy get ready cause it might go
BLAAAAW , how ya like me now ?
The ripper will not allow
You to get with , Mr . Smith , dont riff
Listen to my gear shift
Im blasting , outlasting
Kinda like Shaft , so you could say Im shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And came up with funky rhyme


Breakdown ! ! !

Shadow boxing when heard you on the radio [ HUUUH ! ! ! ]
just dont know
What made you forget that was raw ?
But now got new tour
Im going insane , starting the hurricane , releasing pain
Letting you know that you cant gain , maintain
Unless ya say my name
Ripping , killing
Digging and drilling hole
Pass the Ol Gold


Shotgun blasts are heard
When rip and kill , at will
The man of the hour , tower of power , Ill devour
Im gonna tie you up and let you understand
That Im not your average man
When got jammy in my hand
DAAAAAM ! ! ! ! ! Oooooohh ! !
Listen to the way slaaaaay , your crew
Damage [ UHH ] damage [ UHH ] damage [ UHH ] damage
Destruction , terror , and mayhem
Pass me sissy so suckas Ill slay him
Farmers [ What ! ! ! ] Farmers [ What ! ! ! ]

Dont you never , ever , pull my lever
Cause explode
And my nine is easy to load
gotta thank God
Cause he gave me the strength to rock
HARD ! ! knock you out , mama said knock you out

Greetings , earthlings
We have now taken over your radioooo . . . . .

Goin straight to the hole
You aint got no game
Im breakin ya out the frame
Coming through like train
Looking to take over the whole world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew takin all control
You cant get none of this , were runnin this
Well taker , earth shaker , point gunnin this
Get out the lane , Im comin through
And if you dont wanna move then Im comin right through you

Its like inch by inch and step by step
Im closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough , your whole squad better duck
Its like switch when bust
Now your whole crew is dust
Comin through my area , Imma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your scream scene
Its like showdown on the range
Go tell me who wanna tangle with the
Ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero ?

Chorus :
We want it all ( want it all ! )
Unstoppable , we run the floor ( run the floor ! )
You cant take none of this hardcore ( hardcore ! )
In the game we take you to war ( war ! )
You aint seen nothin like this before
If hit em high , hit em high , hit em high
And you hit em low , hit em low , hit em low
If hit em high , hit em high , hit em high
And you hit em low , hit em low , hit em low

Insane like runaway train Im in your lane
Like its only seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed , you wont like it when change
And you are type strange
Megalomaniacal monster in the game
And got my eye on you
Deadshot aim , as free throws keep comin down like rain
You feelin me , Im feelin you
The Monstar again , Im tellin you
Pass me the rock , now Im headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do
My tactics is unsportsmanlike conduct
You better ask it
Dont get no better than this , you catch my drift ?
You get stripped by ballhandlers ruled by Swackhammer
Danger , youre dealin with offical hoop-bangers
With hang time like coat hanger
Jump , with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc ? The Monstar funk

Lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim , finessin and moves is animated
Once get to ballin , cant be deflated
Im rugged raw , my Monstars is gettin money
When clicks get to buggin , Im snatchin up their bunnies ( Uhh ! )
Every step take shakes the ground
Ill make you break your ankles , son , shakes you down
This is my planet , Im bout business
The best that ever done it , can get witness ? ( Uhhh ! )
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money ?
Or in it for the love , . . ?
23 ways to make pay
Loungin in the mothership back around my way ( Uhh ! )
Im 28 light years old
If the refs get political , dribble like Bob Dole
Am gettin lyrical ?
Daddy , think so
Monstar droppin flavor fluid so drink slow


Yo , God bless ! !
Pick up your chest
Heres an example of how can stress your full court press
With finesse , bench-press your stress whenever you test
Were speed ballin , on the fastbreak just like the pony express
Im gonna mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game
You and your team just need to back off ! !
Get off my block , gimmie the ball , said its my rock ! !
Im startin line-up by gettin yall to bring the livestock
Throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through tell me what you really gonna do ?
Well leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship , we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spending , goal tending , stay-bending teams like crash cars
Who do they be ?
They be the Monstars !


Mmmm yeah ( mmmmm ) check it out baby
Make it hot . . . then we drop it
( oooooooh ! ) Uh , yeah
( oooooooh ! ) Uptown , you know how we do it
Yeah you know
Make it hot


Its the first time together and Im feeling kinda horny
Conventional methods of makin love kinda bore me
wanna knock your block off , get my rocks off
Blow your socks off make sure your spots soft
Im gonna call you Big Daddy and scream your name
Matter fact cant wait for your candy rain
So what cha sayin , get my swerve on , bring it live
Make it last forever , damn the kitty cats tight
Mmm . . . daddy slow down your flow
Put it on me like baby nice and slow
need rough neck nigga Mandingo in sec
Who aint afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back
No doubt , Im the playa that youre talkin about
But do you really think that you can work it out
guarantee shorty its real , baby stick it out
Here comes the man of steel

From the back , from the side

And Im good reaping the girls on the block
And Im good , got this thing on lock
So without me youll be fine , right

All my pride is all have

Youll be needing me , but too bad
( Be easy , dont make decisions when you mad )
You had to your choice to run alone
( know youre independent , you can make it on your own )
Here with me you had home , oh , yeah
( But time is of the essence , why spend it alone , huh )

The nights waited up for you ( Oh , boy )
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
Thats why had to replace you

Uh , uh , uh
It makes cat nervous , the thought of settling down
Especially me , was creeping all over town
thought my tender touch could lock you down
knew had you , as cocky as it sounds
Thats the way you used to giggle right before put it down
Its better when you angry , come here , Ill prove it now , come here

Stop playing you gaming
got to leave you alone

Because Im good holding my spot ( Stop acting like that )
And Im good repping the girls on the block ( Now you know you need to stop )
And Im good , got this thing on lock
So without me youll be fine , right ( Here we go )


People make mistakes to make up , to break up
To wake up cold and lonely , chill , baby , you know me
You love me , Im like your homey
Instead of beef you come hold me
promise Im not phony
Dont bounce , baby , console me , come here

There is nothing you can say to me that can change my mind

And nothing will ever be the same , so just be on your way
Go ahead and do your thing now
And theres no more to explain to me , you no

So Im bouncing and Im out , son

[ LL Cool ] Trizack that sound like heaven
Seven six five four three two one
Cmon , Meth-Tical , come and get some

Playing my position , hot Nick , son
This one , for all the sick ones , infliction
Poisonous darts sickening , best believe
Finger itchin with two broke legs , now Im trippin
On MCs cliche , shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles , hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me , G-O no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly
Tap your jaw from my Punch Buggy sunning you
Got you shittin in your last Huggie , running who
Fuckin punk , get speed bump coming through
single shot make your knees knock , respect Wu

Aiyo put it on nigga , shitted on nigga
Turn Christian to certified sinner
The bomb release , time pent up ( explodes )
While you got set up was hitting your ex ho
Shit kept low , petro your metro
Politic , keep the chickenheads gobblin
Shit Im driving in , come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city , from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty , smack the drivers head in the chin see
When approach rappers be taking notes
drop like shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolute , love to burn to the roots
keep comin til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic

Im the illest nigga alive , watch me prove it
snatch your crown witcha head still attached to it
Canibus is the type wholl fight for mics
Beatin niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough , start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough , and then Ill call your bluff
Like , " Yo , how many rhymes you got ? " think Ill go on
For more Milleniums than Mazdas got on the car lot
And theres nowhere to run ta , when confront ya
Nigga , call your bluff like you had phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild , who wanna act fly and
Get shot down with surface-to air missile
take em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who aint close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty ? Im already doin hundred
When Im blunted and give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark , cause if catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown , come up off that , or Im gon gun it down
When in doubt , however skull goes , its gon be that
See that , that shitll finish you dawg , believe that
Where we at , do you value your life , as much as your possessions
Dont be stupid nigga learn lesson
Im gon get you either way , and its better to live
Let me get whats between your sock , cause its , better to give
Than receive , believe what say when tell you
Dont make me put you somewhere where nobodyll smell you
And when the lights is out , they dont come back on
This aint flick you aint gon come back on
You aint that strong
You knew it was wrong , but you asked for it baby
Youse pink nigga , ski mask for it baby
So can hit you up on Front Street , you think Im sweet
Want heat , one deep , leave him behind , front seat

Aiyyo , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven
Blaze the hot trizack , shine like heaven
Seven , six , five , four , three , two , one
Come on Mr . Smith , come get some

When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed ( yeah , word up )
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
Imma do this shit for free this time this ones for fun
Blow you to pieces , leave you covered in feces
With one thesis ( " LL Cool is hard " )
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But thats like picking up ball , playing with Mike
Swingin at Ken Griffey or challenging Roy to fight
Snapping , you ameteur MCs
Dont you know Im like the Dream Team touring overseas
For rappers in my circle Im deadly disease
Ringmaster , bringing tiger cub to his knees
In the history of rap theyve never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance
Now lets get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side itd transform into time bomb
You dont wanna borrow that , you wanna idolize
And you dont wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socalize
And Im daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position , and mention my name
make rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth dont ever step out of line
LL Cool nigga , greatest of all time
You cant call it comeback
lay back , analyse the rhymes and realise
own that crown for lyrical
Combat
Spit more raps to count more stacks
Kickin back in the coup
got loops relax , Im hotness
Monotonous fans is runnin bizzack
please dont leave the game like thizzat
Never in million years
Lll never let you down baby
drop 50 , steal gravy

[ Hook : repeat 2X ] ( LL )
look back on Venus
look ( look ) back on Mars
And ( and ) burn with the fire
Of ten ( of ten ) million stars ( guess whos back , uh )

Im more then conqueror
Double up your bets
Come and rumble with the decks
know you had that clown picked
Mind blowin out cos still sound sick
You dream you was me
gleam lyrically
love em for it its the highest form of flattery
Doin the buck 10 chrome skating on the battery
My , clutch burnin on top of the world turnin
Rippers is just learnin by stacks been earnin
Im the uncle , future of the funk
Turn my joint up , find out why Im different from all these chumps
And tell your favourite rapper that Im ready to dump
For real cat , that represented rap from the jump


Six figure interest on the cheddar
From music , fashion , film and televison
Poppin amaretto , so whatchu got vendetta ?
never felt better
Now forever competition get severed by skills you cant measure
Im champ , you peon
Kiss the ring , begone
Known and respected on any block you be on
And be on , stand there , get your md on
chuckle cos theres nuthin to waste energy on
There you have it
The uncut raw for rap addicts
Waited three years to see if still had it
Ten million stars
Got beef to the death
End of my contract , Im the last one left !


worth paper
Ask Def Jam who put em up in that skyscraper
( Yeah , take them seriously baby )
Ask my dogs up in old five , who made major ?
LL playa
Now whos next to need paper , drop bomb on em

And burn with the fire
Of ten million stars
( LL Cool )
Thats right yall this is the LL Cool party
Move it , move it , move it , get on the floor baby
Thats right , dont try to front like your fly

( LL Cool )
To rappers Im nightmare on Elm Street
Hellafied hotter than heat , guess why the others cant eat ?
Cause Im carnivore and can eat much more
Than fat man after pack-a jam
. . thicker than butter , well-known throat cutter
When Im involved all the amateurs stutter
Theyre scared and cant believe that their whole crew
Aint rapper alive that can fill my shoes
Im dope on rope , virgins wanna elope
do the hustle and the shuffle and the rope-a dope
Cause Im the hardest hard rock in the hard rock town
gotta . 357 and break it on down

( LL Cool )
Three hundred and fifty seven reasons
Why you gotta get your butt on the floor right now
We aint playin , we came here to get ill
Iller than ill , LL youknowImsayin ?

( LL Cool )
Just like Ali Baba and the 40 thevz
So nasty you dont know whether to stay or leave
More feared , than even Blue Beard , serve Primrose
picture of me , is like one of Michelangelos
dont play the banjo will you ever understand yo
Servin mean the matter how old go Rambo
Cock-strong , half block long
Illy ill fire starter hittin harder than King Kong
Not battle-axe , not run-of the-mill
Not easily knocked out or easily killed
Cause Im the hardest hard rock in the hard rock town
gotta . 357 and break it on down

( LL Cool )
hundred and ninety five pounds punk
More bounce to the ounce and say what counts
KnowImsayin ?
Now get yourself on the floor
Stop actin like sissy

( LL Cool )
Boy , Im better than better is , badder than badder is
wont scare em or dare em Ill just splatter his
Guts kick his butt while Bob is rockin the cuts
Wanna step in the ring with me , you must be nuts
Not Isis in crisis , or Freddy when hes ready , or Jason when hes chasin
My silhouette , scene mean Im icin and acin
Amateurs who lack it , cant hack it , attack it , thats why wanna crack it
Theyre sellin the soul of little kids who cant roll
told em , scold em , teach em and mold em
Get paid ten knots at time and then fold em
remember the blood and remember what told em
can , cant cause Im down with yet you have the audacity
To try and mess with him and me
Hypersonic is weak and Supersonic is wack
Sneak around after midnight , like Siamese cat
Pellum ( , , ) catch twenty-two Im H-A R-D
Im the hardest hard rock in the hard rock town
gotta . 357 and break it on down

( LL Cool )
beatdown can be arranged
Yo baby you look fine spread em
Yo homeboy get up against the wall , whats this in your pocket
What is this ?
Move it , move it , move it

( LL Cool )
Im nappy , sappy crappy imitator of who
If ever imitated it wouldnt be you , ooooh
You dont know so many have died when the LL growl was amplified
Get back better yet step back get dat
Like Shaft and The Mack , cause Im mad and Im black
Im the perfect blend , good boyfriend
Im the reason rap rules the country , Im Cool
J-A M-E ; fresh as cliche , but soul is my forte
Disco is out , rhythm and blues is old news
Ps and Qs keep me in new shoes
And youre dissin me because Im young and Im strong
And Im capable of making platinum LP
Wrong you was , you assumed was all in
But boy is for ballin theyll never say Im fallin
Callin all cars for the brother in black
L-E the Mack back bone of this track
The force full of force to put you on your back
Makin hit after hit , while you search for contract
Hotter than hot now watch how hot can get
Leavin rappers freeze-dried and skimmers dimmers wet
Cause Im the hardest hard rock in the hard rock town
gotta . 357 and break it on down

( LL Cool )
Now the LL posse is now handin out speed knots
To all those who dont want to get busy
Thats right baby get your body on the floor

Cmon , Meth-Tical , come and get some

Playing my position , hot Nick , son
This one , for all the sick ones , infliction
Poisonous darts sickening , best believe
Finger itchin with two broke legs , now Im trippin
On MCs cliche , shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles , hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me , G-O no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly
Tap your jaw from my Punch Buggy sunning you
Got you shittin in your last Huggie , running who
Fuckin punk , get speed bump coming through
single shot make your knees knock , respect Wu

Aiyo put it on nigga , shitted on nigga
Turn Christian to certified sinner
The bomb release , time pent up ( explodes )
While you got set up was hitting your ex ho
Shit kept low , petro your metro
Politic , keep the chickenheads gobblin
Shit Im driving in , come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city , from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty , smack the drivers head in the chin see
When approach rappers be taking notes
drop like shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolute , love to burn to the roots
keep comin til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic

Im the illest nigga alive , watch me prove it
snatch your crown witcha head still attached to it
Canibus is the type wholl fight for mics
Beatin niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough , start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough , and then Ill call your bluff
Like , " Yo , how many rhymes you got ? " think Ill go on
For more Milleniums than Mazdas got on the car lot
And theres nowhere to run ta , when confront ya
Nigga , call your bluff like you had phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild , who wanna act fly and
Get shot down with surface-to air missile
take em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who aint close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty ? Im already doin hundred
When Im blunted and give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark , cause if catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown , come up off that , or Im gon gun it down
When in doubt , however skull goes , its gon be that
See that , that shitll finish you dawg , believe that
Where we at , do you value your life , as much as your possessions
Dont be stupid nigga learn lesson
Im gon get you either way , and its better to live
Let me get whats between your sock , cause its , better to give
Than receive , believe what say when tell you
Dont make me put you somewhere where nobodyll smell you
And when the lights is out , they dont come back on
This aint flick you aint gon come back on
You aint that strong
You knew it was wrong , but you asked for it baby
Youse pink nigga , ski mask for it baby
So can hit you up on Front Street , you think Im sweet
Want heat , one deep , leave him behind , front seat

Aiyyo , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven
Blaze the hot trizack , shine like heaven
Seven , six , five , four , three , two , one
Come on Mr . Smith , come get some

When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed ( yeah , word up )
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
Imma do this shit for free this time this ones for fun
Blow you to pieces , leave you covered in feces
With one thesis ( " LL Cool is hard " )
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But thats like picking up ball , playing with Mike
Swingin at Ken Griffey or challenging Roy to fight
Snapping , you ameteur MCs
Dont you know Im like the Dream Team touring overseas
For rappers in my circle Im deadly disease
Ringmaster , bringing tiger cub to his knees
In the history of rap theyve never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance
Now lets get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side itd transform into time bomb
You dont wanna borrow that , you wanna idolize
And you dont wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socalize
And Im daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position , and mention my name
make rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth dont ever step out of line
LL Cool nigga , greatest of all time
Smoke More Grass

Bitch !
Brick City , yo
Yo , yo Funk Doc straight lunatic since young
ate paint chips the rare moon
That pair mics , my maintenance
battle you and then me and Meth exchange shifts
For money , to your house arrest anklet
take it all , if not , heres thousand
Bricks , be shooting fair ones with bail bonds men
Im constant , on that paper chase
Blow zip codes from bricks to 8-1
Doc serve til you lickin the plate
Battle royal , in the ring smoking like Doc out of oil
Fire thrown to the roof of you apartment
Hit 95 then hide with the Waltons
Down South , the forty-four feela
Im Dolo nigga , you Polo nigga
Im an Uptown shopper , you Soho nigga
Westside highway running , homo nigga

Im the sultan of the ghetto
The homicidal aficionado
empty niggas out like Cristal bottles , uh
When battle , Im breaking Bentleys down to gravel
got the heat right here , we aint got to travel
Im bigger than producers , figured out you losers
knew my longevity confuse ya
Big paper game , come on run into these flames
Recognize the power of the royal King James
Phantom Menace , thats why niggas make faces like they drinking Guinness
When they realize Im not finished
Ive been paid , Ive been platinum , been spittin , uh
Been eatin , been ballin and you know Im shittin
Platinum links , chinky-eyed blonde haired honeys sippin rainbow colored drinks
Black thugs with white minks , ready to jack the brink
Bend your little wifee over help her stretch out the kinks
Thats why ya niggas freeze when step up in the building
The Godfathers here giving blessings to his children
Carats shine , the world all mine
Cant believe these cats is poppin shit about papers in their rhymes
Or bodies they collect , black Gotti shot tech
Them gangsta visions will have you ass up in an ambulance
Cats aint live , look up in my eyes
We can do this one more time , Ill let you decide
The Alize swigger , clock twelve figgas
Think Giulianis rough got some real shit for niggas
Never been defeated , niggas retreated
Made the choice to be seated until my missions completed
Get loose , get loose , Method Man get loose
What the world gonna do when my dogs get loose ?
( Blaze one ) Blaze one ( Blaze one ) Blaze One
Blaze , blaze , blaze one

Now four corners , four seasons
Four MCs with four reasons to bring this game to its knees
And why you down there , suck my dick
My whole motto is fuck it
Hit the smoke shop and blow my budget
MCs abusing my bitch , using my shit
Im hanging off the roof with one hand , losing my grip
Now yall dont wanna see me do that , now do you ?
Go straight cuckoo and terrorize rap , do you ?
do my best work stressed out and under pressure
Deep inside the mind is where youll find my buried treasure
Im still wild , still Tical
Still gritty style , foul , crimi-niminal , individual
Sing song of sixpence
Pocket full of chits
Too many rappers be on John Gottis dick
Now this is something that we dont rehearse
Put that rap shit second , and hip-hop first

Easy , aint Nann niggas spitting like me
Nor Murderers motherfuckin INC
Niggas will pass me , look me in the face , ask me
Are yall really holdin weight or did somebody gas me ?
Ja be the myth , Reggie hand me the fifth let me explain
Your lil man made me give him lift
So you ridin with gangstas
Im up to whole lot of other shit
Murderers is the clique , niggas cant deal with
Try it ( Hataz ) you gonna get yours to the heart
Lesson tonight by the four-four
Niggas want more than little bit , hot shit

To the man that waited on me
At the Starbucks down on Main
hope you understand
When put on that t-shirt
The only thing meant to say
Is Im Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is
Like the elephant in the corner of the south
And just walked him right in the room
Just proud rebel son with an ol can of worms
Lookin like got lot to learn
But from my point of view

Im just white man coming to you from the Southland
Tryin to understand what its like not to be
Im proud of where Im from but not everything weve done
And it aint like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didnt start this nation
Were still picking up the pieces , walking on eggshells , fighting over yesterday
And caught between Southern pride and Southern blame

They called it Reconstruction , fixed the buildings , dried some tears
Were still siftin through the rubble after hundred-fifty years
try to put myself in your shoes and thats good place to begin
But it aint like can walk mile in someone elses skin

Cause Im white man livin in the southland
Just like you Im more than what you see
Im proud of where Im from but not everything weve done
And it aint like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didnt start this nation
And were still paying for the mistakes
That bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught somewhere between southern pride and southern blame

Dear Mr . White Man , wish you understood
What the world is really like when youre living in the hood
Just because my pants are sagging doesnt mean Im up to no good
You should try to get to know me , really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but Im still misunderstood
wasnt there when Shermans March turned the south into firewood
want you to get paid but be slave never could
Feel like new fangled Django , dodging invisible white hoods
So when see that white cowboy hat , Im thinking its not all good
guess were both guilty of judging the cover not the book
Id love to buy you beer , conversate and clear the air
But see that red flag and think you wish wasnt here

Im just white man
( If you dont judge my do-rag )
Comin to you from the southland
( wont judge your red flag )
Tryin to understand what its like not to be
Im proud of where Im from
( If you dont judge my gold chains )
But not everything weve done
( Ill forget the iron chains )
It aint like you and me can re-write history
( Cant re-write history baby )

Oh , Dixieland
( The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin )
hope you understand what this is all about
( Quite frankly Im black Yankee but Ive been thinkin about this lately )
Im son of the new south
( The past is the past , you feel me )
And just want to make things right
( Let bygones be bygones )
Where all thats left is southern pride
( RIP Robert . Lee but Ive gotta thank Abraham Lincoln for freeing me , know what mean )
Its real , its real
Its truth
( LL Cool )
Here we go another funky style
Peace to my brothers on " Rikers Isle "
Introducin the crew , thats goin mile
To get behind the ropes , stop actin wild
This here part is like section one
So you can bug-a loo and set fire to your buns
Early mornin light is yet to come
And when it come , well get buggy in the sun
Females let your hair down
Cause this is how we do it when we go uptown
With the funky sound , the razzamatazz
You give me to the " sploshers " , you can get your-a blast
Enter at your own risk some brothers got weapons
Yet youre still steppin , the beats so funkafied
And answer to the bone , peoplell be dancin alone
Leanin on the wall next to grandmas mop
With the funky , funky groove thats far from pop
Dosey-do your partner all night long
And all you mothers , bring your kids along

( Chorus : LL Cool )
( Yo Uncle ) whassup , whassup ?
( Yo Uncle ) yeah , do little somethin
( Yo Uncle ) whassup , whassup ?
( Yo Uncle ) Huh , do little somethin
( Yo Uncle ) whassup , whassup ?
( Yo Uncle ) yeah , hah , do little somethin
( Yo Uncle ) whassup , whassup ?
( Yo Uncle ) ( just kick little somethin . . . )

( LL Cool )
Aint no mountain high enough to overcome this
Funky-like type of stuff
The feds are ridiculous , they call my bluff
Oh , my wrists are too skinny to hold me with cuffs
got the sure-shot guaranteed mover
Suck it like hoover and do ya whole maneuver
Dont stop till you get it on
With ya head be boppin like bouncy ball
They do it in the park , they do it in the mall
But when do it ( yeah ) , Im doin it for yall
Asiatic , automatic , your funky fanatic without no static
Flippin on the freak like Im acrobatic
You were searchin for the funk and had it
Here we go hand over the cash yo
What chime ? Aiyyo , blast the tobasco
Work your body like dime , oh no
Do the freaky-deaky the whole girls cargo
Females on the side we gotta win em , yeah
The back pockets are stuck with nothin in em , yeah
Except my beeper number , rubbin all my lumber so cannot slumber
Makes me sick like an earthquake
So do the baddy-too true , we got cash to make
Able body , ready to party , all the ladies in the house
Must be eatin hardy
And provin and movin , groovin , so soothin good for ya
And clinically proven damn ! !
Every little bit of the tip makes ya taste flip , like sugar on Ritz
Get on down , to the sure-shot sound
Cause all five burrows are rockin uptown

( Chorus : LL Cool )
( Yo Uncle ) whassup , whassup ?
( Yo Uncle ) yeah , do little somethin
( Yo Uncle ) whassup , whassup ?
( Yo Uncle ) whattup , hah , do little somethin
( Yo Uncle ) whassup , whassup ?
( Yo Uncle ) yeah , hah , do little somethin
( Yo Uncle ) whassup , whassup ?
( Yo Uncle ) aiyyo , aiyyo ( just kick little somethin . . . )

( LL Cool )
Pump up the nasty , nasty , nasty sound
Kick back and let it please ya like rub down
Put ya body in the lost and found
( Kick that ) love the way its goin down
What you see is what you get
And all the words whos next to be the teachers pet ?
Down-home monkey corn fed , original
And what you do is up to you , the individual
This is the place to be for yall underage brothers
With the rebel mentality
Sweet young freaks sayin " Rock me ? Arma-day us ?
Skin so smooth lookin all ( ? ? ? )
Video to video , tape to tape
Walkin through the jam in search of playmate
Party is packed like rich mans fridge
Too many people in the crib
The situation is sweaty and crazy like Eddy
And yes we are ready to funk it up steady
Aint nothin here petty
Trip down to your laund-a ray Im ready ! !
Hold your horse , and baby feel the force
And get jaws off no matter what the cost
Come out to cloth , get hot like stove
Early in the mornin , were dancin in robes
To funkafied sweaty , greazy groove
know the Marley remix to make you move

( Chorus : LL Cool )
( Yo Uncle ) whassup , whassup ?
( Yo Uncle ) yeah , do little somethin
( Yo Uncle ) whassup , whassup ?
( Yo Uncle ) do little somethin
( Yo Uncle ) whassup , whassup ?
( Yo Uncle ) peace out , hah , did little somethin
Love is life and life is living
Its very special
All my love . . .

Oh . . . oh . . . oh . . . oh . . . oh . . .
( Baby , dont go )
( Baby , dont go ) Yeah
( Baby , dont go , uh )
( Baby , dont go ) Yeah
( Baby , dont go )
( Baby , dont go ) Yeah , yeah
( Why you act like that ? )

Its such shame , but Im leaving
Cant take the way you mistreated me
And its crazy , but oh , baby
It dont matter , whatever , dont phase me

Uh , uh , uh
dont believe you wanna leave like this
dont believe just had my last real kiss
do believe well laugh and reminisce
Wait minute , dont bounce , baby , lets talk about this , man

Well , Im bouncing and Im out , son
got to leave you alone

Because Im good holding my spot
And Im good reaping the girls on the block
And Im good , got this thing on lock
So without me youll be fine , right

All my pride is all have
( Pride is what you had , baby girl , Im what you have )
Youll be needing me , but too bad
( Be easy , dont make decisions when you mad )
You had to your choice to run alone
( know youre independent , you can make it on your own )
Here with me you had home , oh , yeah
( But time is of the essence , why spend it alone , huh )

The nights waited up for you ( Oh , boy )
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
Thats why had to replace you

Uh , uh , uh
It makes cat nervous , the thought of settling down
Especially me , was creeping all over town
thought my tender touch could lock you down
knew had you , as cocky as it sounds
Thats the way you used to giggle right before put it down
Its better when you angry , come here , Ill prove it now , come here

Stop playing you gaming
got to leave you alone

Because Im good holding my spot ( Stop acting like that )
And Im good repping the girls on the block ( Now you know you need to stop )
And Im good , got this thing on lock
So without me youll be fine , right ( Here we go )


People make mistakes to make up , to break up
To wake up cold and lonely , chill , baby , you know me
You love me , Im like your homey
Instead of beef you come hold me
promise Im not phony
Dont bounce , baby , console me , come here

There is nothing you can say to me that can change my mind
got to let you go now
And nothing will ever be the same , so just be on your way
Go ahead and do your thing now
And theres no more to explain to me , you no
know your game and Im feeling what you do

So Im bouncing and Im out , son
got to leave you alone , yeah , yeah


promise you
You know what Im saying
Cmon , and you dont stop ( here go another one )
Uhh , uhh , and you dont stop ( here go another one )
Uhh , uhh , and you dont stop ( here go another one )
( Feel me baby , its on )

Uhh , was launched off the block , straight to the top
To yachts with helicopters , Im so hot
Paparazzi , blinded by the rocks
My limousine roll up , the whole world shocked cause
You steppin out with an entrepeneur
copped you more than what you bargained for
Roll the red carpet , enjoy the profits
First , lets make love in the walk-in closet
Daddy just made nine digit deposit
Believe me sweetie , its not luck its logic
Im the captain of my destiny
Used to dream of the things was blessed to see
The jewels and the papers , sports cars and such
Theres nothing in the world LL cant touch
You stood by my side and pushed me so much
Thats why you got them 10 karats , you know what ?

Its so amazing , amazing , amazing
Lifes given my baby , my baby , my baby
Maybe some day youll feel , how feel , its crazy
To see my baby . . is so amazing

[ LL ] Sing it baby

Ive got riches wall to wall
Up the stairs and , down the hall of
All the things that we have done
You got more ideas for us to
Live our lives . . and explore . .
There is no topping you , youre untoppable


So what you sayin ? Uh-huh
Hehehe , appreciate it

Its so amazing , your love , to me
Its so amazing , amazing , to me
Its so amazing , your love , to me
Its so amazing , amazing , to me

Its alright . .
Sometimes you work late at night ( know baby )
( miss you too )
Just as long , as you dont defy my love
Then its on ( promise you baby )
( Ill always love you )

Uh , uh , slide out to Venice , my games in order
Would chip in to vent , but the citys on water
Searchlights and fireworks bling the sky
vowel on the end of everything we buy
Yellow ice in both ears , loosen up the tie
Im lovin this lifestyle , baby cant lie
It feels so good it make grown man cry
Cause made it out the hood and lot of my crew died
guess had determination
And baby girl kept me in the congregation
Now its private jets and deep conversation
Hundred Gs month to show appreciation
All eyes on us , the cameras flash
In God We Trust , dont love this cash
But you was definitely by my side when my world collapsed
Now Im , rich for life and Im payin you back

{ * Amerie ad libs * }


This is like this for life baby

March . . . { * 4X * }
Boomdizzle baby
Way back in 1776
Who would have thought we would have these chicks
Some kind of slim and some extra thick
They make me feel so patriotic
Man , American girls are somethin to see

This is celebration all across the land
Light the fireworks , bring out the marchin band
Uncle , love the heartland
South Carolina , theyre lookin so tan
Out in Kansas , theyre so outlandish
Up in Nebraska , know whatcha after
Bubble baths and Budweiser , joy and laughter
good ol boy thats not tryin to gas ya
American girl , no doubt who the best are
get harder faster than car from NASCAR
Make Paul Revere wanna ride again
The red coats are comin , fuck it , let em in
The King of England woulda left us alone
If he saw Jessica Simpson eat an ice cream cone
Teeny bikini , red white and blue
A-merican girl , salute you
From Massachusetts to Albuquerque
Back to the midwest , as sweet as dessert be

see you out there dancin ; looks like you need romancin
Youre my American girl , A-merican girl
You know wanna hold you ; heres somethin you can roll to
Youre my American girl , A-merican girl ( march ladies ! )
Left , left , left-right left ( march ladies ! )
Right , right , right-left right ( march ladies ! )
Left , left , left-right left ( march ladies !
Right , right , right-left right ( march ladies ~ ! )

Im so glad that French helped us out
Now you free to walk around and let your cleavage bounce
The Founding Fathers wouldve been hot and bothered
Watch boomdizzle , you know what Im talkin about
From Philadelphia to Illinois
St . Louis , Alabama , country grammar
Queens , New York , Detroit to Montana
Todays your day girl , lets raise the banner
Benjamin Franklin , so wanna thank him
Take look at these girls , they the best in the world
Blonds and brunettes , redheads with curls
March with me girl and let your baton twirl
Champagne corks were burstin in the air
Gave prove through the night , my girls were still there
Im drum major , leadin you to the flavor
Go ahead and shake whatcha momma gave ya
Oh , oh , say can you see
By the dawns early light
Par-ty with me every night
Let down your hands , alright
Whatever you do , dont lose this all fast
Imma have to fly my flag at half mast
You go girl , you make me wanna holla
Id take George off and put your boobs on the dollar


Im the master of the ceremony go head yell
Put your hands in the air ring the Liberty Bell
give you the John Hancock if you dont tell
Lets have the Boston Tea party , what the hell !
Celebrate the day Crispus Attucks fell
So we could use our parts and rock to LL
36 double Ds never troubled me
Thank God that Columbus made that discovery
The Queen of Spain spent some change
Now Paris Hilton , is pushin the Range
Stars ride by while the chauffeurs drive
But all you girls with 9-to 5s dance with pride
This is the USA , great to be alive
Great watch the video with them big ol thighs
Brown and blue , green and hazel eyes
All directed straight towards the prize
Any shape or size , all different types of vibes
Around the way girls , ready to ride
Farmers daughter on the John Deere with pride
Conservative blue bloods , intelligent minds
With them Girls Next Door , they put me under spell
Im on top of the world , Imma screamin to tell
love the USA girls
Almost as much as when the Giants beat Green Bay , girl

( You got me shook up , shook down , shook out on your loving )

want girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings , at least two pair
Fendi bag and bad attitude
Thats all need to get me in good mood
She can walk with switch and talk with street slang
love it when woman aint scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jams
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion , using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl shes from around the way

need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
Thats the one for me
Shes the only one for me
need an around the way girl
Silky , milky her smile is like sunshine
Thats why had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
Cause if didnt tell you then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like cookie when see you walk
With your rayon , silk or maybe even denim
It really doesnt matter as long as youre in em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap but petty , youre ready for loving
Youre real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need place to stay
Come around my way

( To the bridge )

Perm in your hair or even curly weave
Wictha New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
tell you come here , you say meet me half way
Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way youre like neighborhood jewel
All the home boys sweat you so youre crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirls crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby , hair pumping , lip gloss is shining
think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got lot of private jokes to share
Lisa , Angela , Pamela , Renee
love you , youre from around the way

Met this little girl she was off the hook
got cold chills when her body shook
Hot sex on the platter , no need to cook

Had her grinding and winding against my leg
She messin with my head , wanna play in the bed
Sexy pumps on , toenails red
Your bodys gun baby , pump me full of lead
It hard to hold you when you moving vulgar
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta
My Pulp aint Fiction , its an addiction
To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen
Nasty girl , taught me all the lingo
While mama play bingo , she ride mandingo
She dont give damn if Im married or single
She makes me tingle , shorty Im your


She likes hip-hop and &
Her lifetime goal is to be on TV
She looking for man that could give her break
Like Usher or Justin Timberlake
Im really not sure if her breasts are fake
Cause with whipped cream on em , they taste just like cake
We drink some beer inside of daddys 64
She shot me in the back with cupids arrow
We finish the 6-pack , she push the seat back
Pulled up her dress and she let me peep that
Im drunk as skunk , feeling all dirty
Truck stop bathroom at : 30
Bought her some dessert , give damn if its early
Head spinning around like roller derby
Everything about her says you dont deserve me
hope Im worthy , cause shorty Im your

And treat you like he should
With me shorty you the shit
He might be good but he aint like this
Cause Im your baby

In the back of the pickup clothing ripped up
She see my chrome wheels , it gets more real
Running and laughing , music blasting
Side over the road bent over crashing
Mouth all dry , can feel the urge
If you see my mama , dont say word
The cops wanna know why my words are slurred
Dont ask me officer ask hurr
" Wanna another drink baby ? " She like , " Sure "
" Wanna hit the club ? " She like , " dont curr "
She all in the rear-view doing her hurr
Hairspray and lip gloss everywhurr
This all happens on an average day
Your life is trip girl , Im here to stay

Yo , Yea , Check it
Ok , alright , huh ok

The other night was up at Farmers , politican wit some bloods
They told me " yo , in the streets you aint gettin no Love
And Ever since the Xs and the Jiggas came out
My niggas aint tryin to the hear that smooth shit you talk about
Whats Up wit that cat Canibus , some played you out
Why you didnt answer back correctly , fuck was that about ? "
As sip on some henny , and try to explain some things
About the life of legend , and all the Drama it brings
Been gone long time , had lot of shit on my mind
decided dont want to reach my goal if it means losing my shine
Streets is Hip-hop and Im Hip-Hop , so the streets is Mine
Ballin as long as you been livin , thats long time
Hard to Stay hungry when your pockets are so fat
You hit hot one in every city on the map
And niggas keep sleepin and you keep coming back
You know better than the gat , but niggas still wanna clap

It feels so good to be back Where Belong
The Streets is Where Belong
They Had me locked down much too long
Hey Hey

Some Say " thats cool , but see times have changed "
Niggas got red bandanas , and the grill in the range
That gold shit is dead , niggas rock platinum chains
Trade . . for Henny , Colt 45 for champagne
Hustling niggas found they way into the game
Extorting all these so called ballers wit big names
And you gotta have squad , cuz running from Def aint safe
know you living good , but aint no smile up on our face
Im like villain , Im representing on my lyrics
And force feed the world , even if they dont want to hear it
As far as Canibus go , my man is hittin his ex-broad
Im getting head from his new piece
While 20 gang-bangers applaud , you came up with that bullshit
Some heads sucked it up , then you dropped that garbage album
And Totally fucked it up , coulda told ya knew your moms
From the after-hours spot , when used to be up in Canada
With the dreads on black block , before you dick rode Lost Boyz
For ticket our to Jersey , but being the man am
tried to show ya mercy , coulda told the World
The way ya label hates your guts
And how me and Wyclef , got together to set you up
And how he gave me half your budget , dont believe me look it up
Ya & promotion niggas , they helped me hook it up
hate to be responsible , for destroying your career
one-hit wonder , huh
No Wonder you disappeared , coulda told the world
You get your lyrics from the internet
Then spit em word for word
Like you really rap vet , How you take metaphors from books
And put em in your rhyme , and how you really from Canada
And you been frontin all this time
heard your second album , that shit is garbage too
LL Cool and did this to you
On that note he said
" Yo , you the man " , said peace , one love
And Drove off in the Lex Land


Yea nigga , the jig is up nigga , huh ha
You know what Im sayin ? , all that bullshit you was talking
Dont mean shit , you finish now

The vanguard award is in my motherfuckin living room
You know what mean ? come get that shit , fuck , what

Both arms , Imma get another one nigga
You Know what Im sayin , this LL you know how get down

He probably did it to get some fame
But is this really what you want ? Hahahahahahahha
Hey { * 4X * }

We gon get it poppin now girl
Get your best dress on tonight
Once we start it aint no stoppin girl
Get your best dress on tonight
This is for the girls
With all those ghetto curves
But we gon get to poppin now girl
Get your best dress on tonight

54-11s poppin wheelies front of Willyburgers
Candy apple M3s , slidin out gently
Rollin up in Bentleys , Tyson was the champ then
Right after the Rooftop , years before the Hamptons
You was ghetto queen and diamond in the rough
You was so beautiful and the world was so rough
Your man was locked up cause the cops popped up
You dropped out of school on top of that you knocked up
He was yo crush , you was his crutch
Hell be gone dime and its hard to stay in touch
Your moms say you stupid but you love him so much
Now its , broken dreams and broken Beemers in the dust
Standin up on crowded bus , for college courses
Stay on course when it gets rough , you never lost it
Stay strong baby trust , youll be back flossin
Diamond studs and linen crush keep your head up


Her boyfriends comin through with them hickeys on his neck
He claims hes lovin her but never shows her no respect
All she knows is neglect , lifetime of stress
Big momma , huh momma , now lil momma is next
You can see the effects of gettin treated incorrect
Cause she let the cycle continue , make excuses for his steps
Her girlfriends tried to warn her , all he wanted wass the sex
Once he get it , then he gone , then its on to somethin fresh
Somethin new , nuttin borrowed , nuttin blue , no weddin dress
But thats aight , you still young , you got your lifetime left
You gotta leave all that alone , find yourself
Theres no love until you love you remind yourself


To all my ghetto girls all around the world
You know the ones with the weaves and the Shirley Temple curls
Keep fightin , uhh
Baby girl keep fightin
To all my ghetto queens survivin by all means
Theres rock and hard place you somewhere in between
Keep fightin , uhh
Baby girl keep fightin , yeah
To all my single mommas you been strugglin with drama
Doin whatchu gotta but still keepin your honor
Keep fightin , uhh
Baby girl keep fightin , yeah yeah , sing it


[ Jamie ] Get your best dress on tonight { * 3X to fade * }
was at the mall , sipping on milkshake
Playing the wall , taking break
Admiring the girls with the bamboo earrings
Baby hair and bodys built to swing
Thats when seen her , her name was Tina
Grace and poise kinda like ballerina
said how you doing , my names Big
Dont ask me how Im living , cause yo , Im living swell
But then again Im living kind of foul
Cause my girl dont know that Im out on the prowl
To make long story short , got the digits
Calls her on my car phone and paid her visit
was spanking her and thanking her , chewing her and doing her
Laying like king on sheets of satin
Thats what time it is , you know whats happening
She had big ole booty , was doing my duty
mean yo , admit that my girls cutie
But Tina was erotic , Earls my witness
With the kind of legs that put stockings out of business
When went home , kissed my girl on the cheek
But in the back of my mind it was this big butt freak
sat my girl down , couldnt hold it in
And said to her with devilish grin

Tina got big ole butt , know told you Id be true
But Tina got big ole butt , so Im leaving you
Tina got big ole butt , know told you Id be true
But Tina got big ole butt , so Im leaving you

went to the high school about three oclock
To try to catch cutie riding my jock
My homeboys jeep , the system blasting
Cold forty dogs , smiling and laughing
Girls all over , the kind adore
felt like kid in candy store
Thats when seen her , her name was Brenda
She had the kind of booty that Id always remember
said to my man , stop the jeep
Shes only senteen but yo dont sleep
kicked the bass like an NFL punter
And scoped the booty like big game hunter
said to the girl , yo , you look tired
Lets go get some rest , relax by the fire
put the big booty on bearskin rug
She gave me kiss , have her hug
said to the girl , them young boys aint nothing
You want to get freaky , let me kiss your belly button
circled it and teased it and made her squeal
Grabbed pack of bullets and pulled out the steel
When was through , wiped the sweat from my eyes
When to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies
Tina busted in my house while was eating
You know what said
Too bad you caught me cheating but

Brenda got big ole butt , know told you Id be true
But Brenda got big ole butt , so Im leaving you
Brenda got big ole butt , know told you Id be true
But Brenda got big ole butt , so Im leaving you

went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak
Around the time whe the waitress are on their lunch break
pulled in the parking lot and parked my car
Somebody shouted out , dont care who you are
paid it no attention , walked inside
Because Brian had nine and he was chilling in the ride
walked in the place , everybody was looking
And shrimp and steak wasnt the only thing cooking
sat down to eat , ordered my food
said to the waitress , dont men to be rude
But Ill take you on platter
She said you got girl , said it dont matter
You look like youre tastier than piping hot pizza
Whats your name , she said my tag says Lisa
said , . . , youre smart and all that
But when you get off work , yo , Ill be back
She looked at me and said make yourself clear
where we going , said right here
She looked kind of puzzled , said youll see
pulled up at ten on the . .
When she walked out the door , threw my tongue down her throat
Pushed her back inside and pulled off her coat
Laid her on the table and place my order
And gave her tip much bigger than quarter
On and on to the breaka dawn
All over the restaurant , word is born
heard somebody coughing , checked my watch
couldnt believe it said nine oclock
grabbed my pants , put on my Kangol
Who did see , oh yo it was Brenda
Yo she worked at Red Lobster but didnt remember

Lisa got big ole butt , know told you Id be true
But Lisa got big ole butt , so Im leaving you see ya
Lisa got big ole butt , know told you Id be true
But Lisa got big ole butt , so Im leaving you see ya
You ever get to the point where you so frustrated
You ready to give up ?
You ready to end it all ?
Dont do it dog , word up
dont care if you black , white , latin , asian , whatever
We all go through pain
When you cant think . . use your soul baby

Preliminary discussions is over with , the verdict is in
took the rap throne back
reigned like krills in eighty-seven , my name is on the map
It feels like razor down the middle of my back
They slept on my lyrical ability to blow
Gave another nigga credit for inventin my flow
Im child of God , witness the risin son
From the cradle to the grave , remain number one
This thing of ours , got competition takin red showers
Grievin mothers callin 1-800 Flowers
My repoitoire burn your ashes in the urn
Is it God or money that really make the world turn ?
Grab your gun , seperate the ones from the real funds
Inhale deep and hold it in your lungs
The streets was requestin some original LL
soundtrack for niggas that was raised in { hell }
They lookin for leader that can guide em through the maze
Smoke filled rooms , breathin in purple haze
Po niggas on the bricks his whole life
He aint got nuttin to live for , so fuckin livin right
But if you stay in the rain like hurricane
Gold melts down but it dont fear flames
Toxic , lethal , psychologically evil
Genocide was committed on the black people
And the ghetto is trap with glass walls
Should sell drugs , be rap thug , or play ball ?
We end up in the grave anyway
The average cat and LL Cool
Its never ending cycle , life and death
Until then may my mic stay blessed , to the death

Chorus : LL Cool

CANT THINK ! Why do feel Im losin my mind ?
CANT THINK ! Could it be the ill beats and rhymes ?
CANT THINK ! Even though Im one of kind
CANT THINK ! want the paper , thats just the bottom line
CANT THINK ! Mo murder every day around the way
CANT THINK ! Id rather get paid and parlay
CANT THINK ! Its all about survival God
{ * scratched * " You know the epilogue by James Todd " Biggie Smalls }

Put your life on the line , you runnin out of time
The coroners callin , she know she on nigga mind
Amongst the dogs , real cats is hard to find
Even nigga MOMS hate it when he start to shine
Get the money and run , dodge the devil and his sons
Spit powerful parables like sermon has begun
Fuck the turntables up , leave the DJ awestruck
Attitude is WHAT , keep the razor blade tucked
Too much flossinll get your reputation touched
Too much rappinll get your big mouth shut
Protect your neck nigga , youll get it in the gut
You wearin vest ? What if you get your throat cut
Sold your soul for dollar , now you havin bad luck
Used to keep bad bitch in the crib baggin up
Player here , player there , nigga turned you out
But never told you beware
Never told you that black love supposed to be shared
And you never judge woman by the texture of her hair
Fancy cars and gold teeth , G-strings and things
The almighty dollar replace the wedding ring
The Ark of the Covenant was held by king
aint tradin my soul in for skins and chrome rims

Chorus

Think about it yo , think about it
Think about it yo , think about it
Think about it yo , think about it
Think about it yo , think about it !
The dawn , of new millenium , came to pass
The world revolves around sex or cash
The black mans motto , " Kiss my ass ! "
Shorties in kindergarten are strapped , ready to blast
All ever seen was killers and dopefiends
From FEDS Magazine to the heart of killer Queens
Bronx and Brooklyn and everything up in between
No matter what , you always got Judas on your team
Givin it to the world and Im tellin it like it is
Tossin lyrical daggers and sendin em in your wig
Know where the bodys buried , aint sayin where it is
Raised inside the ghetto , but damnit WANNA LIVE !
The legendary master of lyrical combat
But aint no competition , aint nobody to go at
So Imma take the time and spit universal verse
Hit the streets with blessin and erase the curse

Chorus
( Nothing can save ya
Nothing can save ya
Nothing can save ya
* scratched * Nothing )

Just throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just dont care
Keep em there
Yo , run the jewels , run the jewels , run the jewels

( Can you feel it )

used to be rollin like millionaire
Cash in flash , bankroll to spare
Homeboys hangin , champagne and girls
Got my main woman Diamonds , my mistress Pearls
Everybody laughin at my corny jokes
was stupid ; thought that they were sincere folks
It turned out they liked the money and the fame
If aint get paid , Id be that nobody James
The nobody , who dreamed about bein somebody
Chief rocker at the party
And they was hangin like , " Yo , Im your man
dont even care about the ring on your hand "
Wed go out to eat and chill
But they would go to the bathroom when it was time to pay the bill
didnt notice all the chuckles and laughter
Too busy with female tellin me Im the master
was slick like , " Huh , do know you ?
got play , here , let me show ya "
Used to have girl that was on the ball
When the cash flow got low , so did her calls
Used to have homeboy , always chillin
My cash went low , he told me was illin
And dont call cause he dont hang with derelicts
Broke with no cash , yo , was in the mix
Everybody stepped cause my pocket wasnt fat
My girl got new man , fixed his flat
Im the one that theyre laughin at
They say , " Cheesy rat , you aint all that "


mean crabbin , played out by backstabbin ; feel like tiein
anchor to my ankle and jumpin right in the ocean
Cause Im ashy and cant afford lotion
So-called friends in the jewelry store
Told me , " Todd , come back when you get off tour "
Souped as hell , really regret it
Now the only thing got in my pocket is bad credit
How can man like me
Be walkin around in world of misery ?
And if women like man with body , its not mine
Cause they be walkin past me like Im stop sign
My homeboys laugh when they pass the forty
Sayin , " Todd , as if he used to have sporty "
The Benz was slammin , the Jeep was pumpin
Aint that somethin ?
just laugh , this isnt what was raised for
When walk away , its like aint this
Kick in the rear , that Im standin here
And cant afford tissue for my tear
Should drink wine and brandy
Or get job puttin stripes on candy
Or put hole in donuts ?
Cause when youre broke , your middle name is " so-what ? "
had to learn in an incredibly fast way
When you aint got no money they treat you like an ashtray
pawned all my jewelry and clothes
Right after that , got dissed by all the hoes
That thought was mine , but really never was
Soon the whole neighborhood got the buzz
That my tank was on " " , and that means empty
That Twinkie looks good , so mister dont tempt me
Everybody thought was trippin
rode the back of the bus , but my grip kept on slippin
Im the man that theyre laughin at
They say , " Cheesy rat , you aint all that "


wanna hang with my man like , " Lets do this "
But this man like " Who this ? "
Thats right , the brother got two faces
They got me puttin the tips on shoelaces
on the Puma , mop and bucket
My motto is . . . dont care
dont give damn , so what , why try ?
might as well rob some Blake Carrington sucker for his money
Its so funny
Cars ride by with the boomin system
Sayin , " Leave him alone , my man already dissed him "
Now Im on the cheeseline , poverty-stricken
As the red tape thickens
go to the park , they wanna baseball-bat me
go to the mall , they throw my old tapes at me
Im so horny
And every girl know be like , " Hes so corny "
want money in hurry
Im gettin tired of leftover curry
wanna fall off , but dont know where the edge is
Im so hungry , eat my neighbors hedges
Now realize gotta go for mine
Its windshield time
take quarters , pennies , dimes and nickles
And kiddys tricycle
Im desperado
" Ima steal your rims " is my motto
watch wrestlin until Im dizzy sore
So if youre cashin your rent check , know how to get busy
Go to the drive-through , run with milkshake
Go to the supermarket , pocket raw steak
need beer
Imma catch the Miller truck out there
You know how they throw , the newspapers in the morning
The owner dont want em
Im the man that theyre laughin at
They say , " Cheesy rat , you aint all that . "


So yo , one more time , one more time
Party people in the house tonight

Just throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just dont care
Keep em there
Run the jewels , run the jewels , run the jewels
Yeah . .
Yeah like that guitar man , yeah
Yo E-Love like the way you flipped that guitar man
Knahmsayin ? It was good idea man , knahmsayin ? Yeah
Its kinda like freakin me , yaknahmsayin ?

Just gon chill , check it out

Slick as Vasoline , smell good as cologne
Im like muscle man in jail they leave me alone
rhyme like Superman , you rap like Jimmy Olson
break you like bottle of green Golden Molson
You aint real rhymer , you look like actress
How you gon sleep on me holmes , do look like mattress ?
Am that old , do walk like Grady ?
Imma hundred-fifty proof , Smirnoff is only 80
Dont you EVER try to rock my house
Im real cool cat , know what Im sayin Mickey Mouse ?
The poetry specialist , so take dose of this
Now think about it can you really come close to this ?
You soft as powder , weak as cabin cooler
Ugly as work shoes , messin with the Ruler :
The ultimate writer reciter and def entertainer
work myself harder than boxers trainer

Chorus : LL Cool

Clap your hands everybody ( aiyyo )
And everybody just clap your hands ( aiyyo )
Clap your hands everybody ( aiyyo )
And everybody just clap your hands ( aiyyo )

And everybody just clap your hands ( aiyyo )
Clap your hands everybody ( aiyyo )
And everybody just clap your hands ( aiyyo )

You end up , underneath my sneaker
Youre dog doo-doo , Im watchin you get weaker
You cant believe , the skill and dexterity
LL Cool , and the is for Jeremy
So BUFF ME , James Todd the earthquaker
Thats right my brother , youre goin out like Sega

One of my * ballads * ll get your girlies in the mood
Sucker MCs really make me sick
Im so bad , can suck my own { dick }
If you go to your girls house and Im there already
Dont go Crazy cause my name aint Eddie
Rhymes so rough , its like course in trigonometry
When Einstein was talkin , he was talkin bout ME
The Prince of the Earth , and Imma give birth
To rhyme so hard you look soft as Smurf
Gigglin and wigglin , so how we goin out ?
LOVELY , and thats without doubt !

Chorus / 4X

Rappers are my servants , they serve me like an emperor
When Im through , youll need nurse to take your temperature
And cool you down , cause youre cold as leftovers
Not the ones on the table , Im talkin about RUFF rovers
You cant get over whats my name , Goofy ?
You smoke Im no joke , so my brother break out the looseys
And take pull , cause the buck stops here
get swift as magician , wreck { shit } and dissapear
Dont cross me , or lose your loyalty
To the Prince of the Rap Court , Im royalty
And it aint no puzzle , its shame how rappers guzzle
Paragraphs put together so carry muzzle
To shut em up and cut em up and make em be quiet
Im one man RIOT , so dont even TRY IT
The Prince of special tactics , plus Im athletic
Before you play your hand you better do some calisthetics
Jumpin jacks , squats , push-ups , the whole nine
Speak your piece , then Imma go for mine
And guarantee you , Im gonna strike again
recommend my friend you drop the pen and give in
Cop out to one rhyme cause youre facin ten
aint Sidney Poitier but we can Do This Again
Im nice wit mines , and gotta admit it
You dont really wanna battle , why dontcha just forget it !

Chorus /

But if youre hard headed and you still dont understand
Heres little sample EHM EHM , my man

And everybody just clap your hands ( aiyyo )
Cause rock the house , everybody ( aiyyo )

Twent-five years in the state penitentary
Tried to pull off the biggest crime of the century
Pulled out the ten-side nine milimeter
Went out to rob , sticking up sweeter
Never had job you gonna work for ya
Major escape but basehead saw ya
You got it under control , you rock and roll
Crime is in your soul , you go on for the goal
Comin home late with your trigger finger aching
Got in the beef for some buckwilds ( ? ) they making
Drivin fast , can lay in the lane
Caught with kilo , now explain !

Dont do the crime , if you cant do the time ( Crime Stories ! )
Dont do the
Crime , if you cant do the time
Dont do the crime , if you cant do the
Time
Dont do the crime , if you cant do the time
Dont do it !

Uzis , nines , forty-fives and Macks
Cocaine on the brain , gold chains and jacks
Hitman for hire , big contracts
In fact he got macked cause the eye-contact
Bought . 38 so now hes wanna-be master
Come on , baby , eat steak and lobster
got Mercedes-Benz , be as double ( ? ) as your friends
But what about the hidden camera lens ?
Cortex-style , but youre countin that money
Then the brothers who diss think they sooo funny
They took yours you thought you was nice
But now pay the price they put you on ice !


{ * Judge talking * }

Guilty ! You get paid for crime
get paid to rhyme on time and in my mind
see might have to find even harder groove
got smarter move
No crime no time , now thats smooth
Who wants to play cell and waste time as well
Id much rather be than in hell
Cause might never go and stick up sell
And end up like them with dry pistol smell
Id much rather earn mines and get mines
Make up stacks and cracks and write def rhymes
He cuts so quick and Im sharp as knife
got sentenced to rock , 25 to life !


Cut-throat killer , proud of the fact he kills
He got in the beef , he said stand back to chill
Pulled out the gun , the crowd started to run
BOOM ! ( ? ) boy is done !
Went around braggin , yeah boy dit it , admit it
The description of the killer fit it
If the cops wanna catch me , they better come with it
shot the bullet and homeboy bit it
Like ( ? ) , put pounder
Im fond kill or be killed , long as my pockets get rounder
Im on my own , Im alone , and roll for me
Caught with pistol 1-2

Soulja !

Aye , in my apartment long time ago
knew bad bitch , but she was kind of slow
Still gave it up when its few of us
She let me finger fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She want to hang with us , we want one thing
Just penetrating her throat , dawg
She choke on it like smoke , dawg
But whenever fucked up my reup
In dice game go see her
Shell give me enough to buy quarter ounce
And then blow blunt of that reefer
She used to buy nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can page to put " 69 "
And know it time to go freak her
Then one day just asked her
" Why you always give your ass up ?
mean damn these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid , this shit dont add up . "
She said , " Tip , all wanna do is feel love
Even if know it aint real love
Even if know nigga only finna hit it
And then never call back , still fuck "
And thats fucked up , shes so trill
need something , she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga , guess where we go chill ?
For bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds til it goes down
remember shawty , she stayed down
wont say her name because she married now

When the lights go out
And Im in my bed
think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that did back then
When Im in my bed
think of all the memories Ive had
All of the things did back then

She would always turn heads when shed fall through
She would always make moves how boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me , she had thing for me
When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me
And wed both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watching just to see if the police coming
We got close over time , her and
Right around the time that first got signed
Come to think about it was bout 17
aint even have license , couldnt even drive
was going back and forth with each flight
Another show after show , each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
Shed go through my phone and wed fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasnt really much more that we could do
Wasnt really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But guess one night had few
Huh , one night had few
Yeah , this little chick that caught my eye
told her " hurry up , meet me at the room "
And no , didnt have contraceptive
What my common sense neglected
And two months later next thing know
got text that said " Im pregnant "
And you can almost bet she kept it
And thats the reason why you left me
On top of all that , it wasnt even mine
went and got paternity tested
Damn !


Wait , hold up , is that you ?
With them big ol thighs after school ?
Jay 305 had gave me high five
new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride , tried to improv
But no freestyle never do
You looking for the nigga with the tallest fetti
To make it rain on you like Im about to break levee
Hold up , that pussy petty
Yeah , your nails did , your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with Hummer
Her new prima donna smelt it
Tried to make you mine , ho !
Tried to make some time , ho !
To stop and wait in line , ho !
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas
Fuck you and Mick Romney
Change my phone now
When get home now
got o-o o-options
Fast forward , wait is that you ?
With them big old thighs after school ?
And your kids and baby daddies
know

All that bullshits for the birds
You aint nothing but vulture
Always hopin for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
Who knows just what need , she knows just what mean
When tell her keep it drama free

Chuckin up them ( deuces )
told you that Im leaving ( deuces )
know youre mad , but so what
wish you best of luck
And now Im finna throw them deuces up

But Ill fuck you right , will , fuck you right , will
mean this part of our relationships amazing still
might just put up with the arguing and stay , for real
You looking bad , girl for goodness sakes
You with all those curves , and me without no brakes , ooh
You feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us
Our timing is wrong
Your friends always tying up every line on your phone
And the hardest part about the fucking business is minding your own
And every time try and break it off
We just yell until we tired then break you off
Even when throw them deuces , you just send it back around

Your wrist and fingers glisten ; ice cold like Michigan
Look at what we livin in , here we go with this again
just keep on talking but guess that you aint listening
Rather run around with them nothing ass bitches then
Go on , got me hot , smoking like chimney
We used to be best friends , now it seems we finna be enemies
To see her in that two seater , now thats gon hurt your feelings , boo
By now so you go sleeping with them clowns , they are no relief
She spoke her piece , know , capisce
So love must be let go , released
Into the wind , again , again . and deuces must throw ya peace

You know what , yo ? You bitch
You should have travel agent , cause you trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
hate niggas , but love your mom
Give her kiss for me , her second son
Get your mind right baby or get your shit together
Girl seducers , they come in deuces
But when cut em off they always become nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth

According to my old bitch be on some new shit
She was on some old shit , now got new bitch
Think give two shits ? you aint gonna do shit
Meet my two fingers , intro-deuces
Wanna get the middle finger , but got two better

Know you gonna


Four door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be bad business choice
Oh , you talking , what about ?
If it aint how kept you studded out
You might as well shut ya mouth

Got pocket full of hundreds
She the only one is missing
Got bucket full of ice , and watch to go with it
Got racing Lamborghini have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down they know that boy be fly
. . . . . on that wall in the hall of fame
let my denim sag # red Louis belt
How can you love me baby , first you gotta love yourself

The farewell email from female
What it entails is hard to say like selling seashells
But neither whore who needs to know more
Or run in your favorite store and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it aint yours
did things for , aint rich aint poor
want it to do more but hell just aint know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousins house to see if was there
Get ya minds out the gutter man
We out here tryna have good time
And here am , all heavy with the words where
Somebody thats nerd , likely fast forward
But shit they asked for it
You start to sound like Confucius when making up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
gotta find me new locomotive , stop making sad songs

Im on some new shit
Im chucking my deuces up to her
Im moving on to something better , better , better
No more trying to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye , say bye bye , say bye bye to her ; to her

Home of the brave and free
Free just to murder me
Land of the beautiful
Cursed by the hate we throw
Is this the new national anthem ?
Is this the new national anthem ?
Turn it !

You say this the home of the brave guess
On chrome with Tek taught to spray for respect
Bought work from the vets burning rubber in the Vettes
This as good as it gets used to play with the rats
Then got older and learned stay away from the rats
God blessed this nigga , to hustle up and make eight figures
Turned from goon to great young nigga
No complaining just doing what it take young nigga
was raised in decade of hate young nigga
Always dodging polices because they hate young niggas
And we hate them too , 38 in him shoe
All the changes the system will take him through
Let him have life sentence then do it with smile
And she cried , still they just put him inside
Now she all on her own because her other son died
Listen to the politician as he lied and he lied
He snake in suit , trying to hide in disguise

( Well damn officer what did do ?
Ay , man what you doing ?
You trippin , dawg
How many times has that ever happened to you , what the fuck do you know about being black man in America ?
And you wonder why we walk around with straps )

For the stars and the stripes prison bars and the pipe
Young nigga rolling weed in cigar he can light
Bang red either blue selling hard and the white
Live by the gun , never run from fight
Trayvon in hoodie , walking through the neighborhood he
jury of his peers said all was forgiven
Like they killed Malcolm , Edgar Hoover did that
You can catch me in the hood where they shooting niggas at
Whether Piru or VLs or GDs wit me we

My partners looking at me to see if my eyes open
Cause Ive been dranking and Ive been smoking
Flying down 285 but Im focused
454 SS , race Porsches
White leather seats , as fresh as Air Forces
Doing bout hundred but the track still bumping
Number on . . , " Straight Outta Compton "
Pull up at your apartment sitting on 20 somethings
And the dope boys hollering " Whats happening ? " kid running in
The cliques start dancing and the broads start choosing
And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
Sign pictures , buy an onion of good and throw the deuces
Cause aint Hollywood , come from the hood , Im used to it
If your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating
24 inch Daytons got the Chevrolet skatin makin

Diamonds gleam when Im on the scene , they know its me
Aint no dream or no fantasy bitch , its T-I
Broad busting , like baby do binky
Five karat DVSs on my mothafuckin pinkie
Half of Hennessy and Belvederes what we dranking
Pimp squad send for broads , what the hell you niggas thinking ?
Young nigga spending weekends on the islands in the fall
24 inch rim shining when Im riding cause Im balling
Im calling out shots like pool shark
My tools spark in the dark when fool marks
Yall fools hearts in the wrong place at the wrong time , got strong mind
To grab my chrome nine and shoot at your ass for long time
But Imma get that ass hauled off , fuck around with the clique
Theyll be looking for your dick with stick , nigga yall soft
So yall lost , Imma ball at all costs , spit game at dame
Make her ride on this thang til she falls off and sucks balls off , got the

Bragging about pistols at the house , guess whos strapped right now
Keep on talking folk , Ill lay you on your back right now
Want to act right now , get smacked right now
Im buck mothafucka , dont know how to back down
Clown down with your faggot friends talking bout what you making , nothing
Im 21 and 10 years deep , that shit to me aint nothing
Im raised by the niggas getting head from the jays
Lose your leg when spray , end up dead from the
Stay ready for the raid , paid heavy from the yay

Lame ass nigga just fuck my cool up

For her it would never stand up
Hanging out with my balls , like " hell nigga naw "
Fuckin suckas now you dealin wit some real niggas yall

First Benz for yourself , baby mama get Hummer
Get crib for your mama , pass the chopper to the gunner

Trae-tha Truth Gates , young nigga rich
Who the fuck you niggas think youre talking to bitch
Middle fingers up play it safe , eat dick
Run up in the field when gun move around
Balled on hater , you aint see me shoot around
Never walk up out the club til money cover the ground
All gold chains they weigh about 10 pounds
Tryna find slut that fucks for 10 rounds
tell her go long get ready for 10 downs
Mention my name it rang in all towns
King of turf my throne is all brown
Hustle gang bitch , my hustle is out of order
When Im done with that get back in somebody daughter

The planet that Im from , cant even speak on
The stars is what sleep on
The moon put my feet on
The way my aura glow , youd swear Im made of neon
Cooler than the freon , thats in your Dodge Neon
They say the future is now , to me it hasnt begun
Stay tuned to me and their will never be re-run
So come and leap on my body and as we come
Youll probably feel moist like the trees on the tropics
We gone , we out it , no we dont need rockets
We hop up on the mother ship an we gone , we slidin
We slippin through dimensions , we hyper space glidin
Blastin through the atmosphere

Man just came up in the game cause yall just needed more life
So , so by the time Im done their aint gonna be no more mics
And people ask me , " . . what kind of language is that ? "
Cause may blast into the future , may never come back
And Im leave with 30 , 000 light year leap
Headed to distant planet called . .
And then Im gone
Man they not ignoring me
Taking off from half court Air Jordan
All systems go in 10 seconds Im orbiting
Hanging in the Cosmos like space ornament
Heat em up like solar panel , yes bring the pain
Similar to asteroid thats headed to your brain
My lane is something that they really cannot explain
They try to hold me down but man its me they cant contain


Come and go with me , Ill take you to my galaxy
Im talkin bout Venus , Jupiter , Mars , Mars , Mars
And Im sayin girl , lets ride all night

And Im about to take it to another level , bitch
No matter who you go and get
Aint nobody cold as this

And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch , acting like owe her shit

Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so yeah had to act sane

If you wanna make your # your # now "
Mix that Goose and Malibu call it " Malibooyah "

Dejaste en mi cama tu aroma sudor

Quiero que hagamos el amor como animales
Similar aquella noche cuando fuimos indomables
Agresivo salvaje
Infermitos incurables

Yo no te dije ni una frase de amor
No te lleve serenata tu ventana
Nos hicimos sentir un ratito feliz


Romeo . . .
Its me , yo , the CEO
Dame beso , yo necesito
Dominicana , Puerto Rico
Yeah , Im-a give you this hit ; caliente
But Imma need big sweet Presidente
Baby , you like it rough ?
Give it to me toda la noche
Por favor , baby , rip me right out of my Dolce
Gabbana , como animales
Baby , como animales

Ven mi , no arruinemos el momento
No hay tiempo pa palabras
Que la noche se haga larga , larga , larga , larga . . .


When Nicki entered the rap game , she did so presenting familiar image : beautiful , sexual , playful black woman that could deliver an energizing stage presence , feminine swagger , and above all big fat ass . The only difference was that , up until then , that packaged image had been relegated to the background of music videos and to the arms of your favorite male rapper . But Nicki came with the mic in hand . She was butt with lyrics




This is the autobiography of Nicki Maraj

May the lord protect me as the world gets hectic
My voice projected , my life reflected

Daddy was crack fiend , two in the morning
Had us running down the block like track team
When you burnt the house down in my mother was in it
How could forget it ? The pain is infinite
Shes my Queen , and aint even British
She is the only reason that went to school and finished
She told me that had talent , got on her knees
And prayed for me when started being violent
She saw something in me that , til this day
dont know if could be that
But Imma die tryin , and when Im done cryin
Grab the iron and black out like Im retiring
Nightmares of you killing my mother
The reason that sleep with my head under the covers
And they shoulda thrown book at you
Cause hate you so much that it burn when look at you


Damn wanna run to you
Hold you and kiss you and tell you how miss you
Thought would have son for you
But now its official , its over and cant let you go
But gotta let you know all the shit did
Made me feel like Im dyin real slow
Cause no one understands me , they dont know
What to do when Im hurt , when Im angry
You was my friend , and my man and my daddy
You was there when that bitch tried to stab me
Anything ever needed knew you had me
Cause of you all them chicks couldnt stand me
So why hurt you ? Thats the question
It took this long for me to learn my lesson
Cause now all want is peace ; forget drama
finally understand the true meaning of karma


Please baby forgive me , mommy was young
Mommy was to busy tryna have fun
Now dont pat myself on the back for sending you back
Cause God knows was better than that
To conceive you then leave you , the concept alone seems evil
Im trapped in my conscience , adhered to the nonsense
Listened to people who told me wasnt ready for you
But how the . . . would they know what was ready to do ?
And of course it wasnt your fault
Its like feel it in the air , hear you sayin
" mommy dont cry cant you see Im right here ? "
gotta let you know what you mean to me
When Im sleeping see you in my dreams with me
Wish could touch your little face or just hold your little hand
If its part of Gods plan , maybe we can met again

From jump , Nicki has been criticized for swiping multiple pages out of Lil Kims book . When those comparisons wore thin , everyone decided it was Lady Gaga she was biting . But the mark of any great artist , and intelligent business person , is the ability to adapt . Just look at Jay .



Now every club promoter wanna bid like auctions
Cause we pack shows , sell tix like Boston
You see me in the lobby taking pics and flossing
After every pic , gotta fix my corset

Batter up bitches but approach with caution
You be talking slick , and honestly , could see why
You dont know me and aint talking bout .

But you cant tell me that am not the baddest bitch
Im the baddest bitch , the mistress , Im the baddest bitch
Im the baddest bitch , trick , t-trick please Im the baddest bitch

Half bar just to laugh at em
High school , if he ball , throw my math at him
And if he wants some pussy , thats no no

Flow sicker than LL

Word to me , all them girls better bow down
Nicki Minaj , Im the talk of the town now

Been around the world , still cant find
Another girl that could steal my shine

Man nigga just broke in my spot
He stole some money and some weed and watch
Fuck talking , just want to hear shots

lost load , New Mexico , they fucking pulled her over
Crush and roll soldier , boulder crest soldier
And told my bitch to quit me cause never will propose to her
And as get older my jewelry get colder
But why the task force had to put me in the folder
Rest in peace to Soldier Slim , that boy there was soldier
Rest in peace to Pac and Big , cause them niggas was soldiers

No barking from the dog , no smog
And momma cooked breakfast with no hog

Finally got call from girl wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as hit the door
Thinking will live another 24
gotta go cause got me drop-top
And if hit the switch , can make the ass drop
Had to stop at red light
Looking in my mirror and not jacker in sight
And everything is alright
got beep from Kim , and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and Im asking yall
" Which park are yall playing basketball ? "
Get me on the court and Im trouble
Last week fucked around and got triple double
Freaking niggas every way like MJ
cant believe today was good day

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didnt even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexing , didnt even look in niggas direction
As ran the intersection
Went to Short Dogs house , they was watching " Yo ! MTV Raps "
Whats the haps on the craps ?
Shake em up , shake em up , shake em up , shake em
Roll em in circle of niggas and watch me break em
With the , 7-11 , 7-11
even back door Lil Joe
picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones , and Im yelling domino
Plus nobody know got killed in South Central LA
Today was good day

Left my niggas house paid
Picked up girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
Its ironic , had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep , so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didnt hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and Im coasting
Took another sip of the potion , hit the 3-wheel motion
was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didnt even see berry flashing those high beams
No helicopter looking for murder
in the morning , got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read " Ice Cubes Pimp "
Drunk as hell but no throwing up
Half way home and my pager still blowing up
Today didnt even have to use my AK
got to say it was good day

Yeah , word is bond

Straight from the sewer , word is bond

On permanent vacation , off the Massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga , what you thinking bout
Get rid of that Devil real simple , put bullet in his temple
Cause you cant be the Nigga Life crew
With White Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams , now gotta play the Silence of the Lambs

And broke groupies and hootchies dont faze me

To put platinum and gold on the record shelf

Before you do record , partner , handle your business

You gotta watch your back stay strapped , be alert
Started as young muthafucka doin dirt

We aint losin playa ( never ) , weez winnin

While you still chasin women round tables no lieutenants
Use your own man grown , ( hook it up )

Breakin bread every night in .
And pray , for one more day thats unate ( check it )
Its 90 degrees no enemies in sight
Even the Don gotta fall to his knees every night

Keep my shoulder on the wall like the county
Cause you buster-ass niggas cant clown me

Jay-Z : International
Ice Cube : Papa Dock
Ice Cube : What up Jay
Jay-Z : Show young boys how to do this thing
Ice Cube : You know me , Ice Cube , Im like Glock nigga , always got hot sixteen , knamean

was young lad of seventeen
My life had yet to show its ugly face
Remember three , thousand
The one who used to pray to be rapper
My childs in the third grade
His favorite rapper wasnt rapping till he heard me
wasnt rapping till heard something called Erik
And Rakims Paid in Full
Rappers really gettin paid in full
So full that the kids dont go to school in hopes of becomin one of us
The only requirement is your bus
Now college is lookin slim , product is hookin them
Before their brains fully develop they get enveloped by the the vision tele
The television tells them their vision
Now its hard for them to make decisions with out feelin
Uncooled , unschooled , thumb rule
Rule of thumb , cant be dumb
wish wouldve studied abroad
Well studied broad and she studied me back
And my course was hard
That was that , this is this , listen up
Cause all Im saying is
If thirtys the new twenty , thirtys the new twenty for them wheels as well
They lookin for the mic or some pills to sell
While the girls are steady graduatin
Niggas standin on the corner hatin , debatin
Well should get the new Js or the Kobes
And they rollin so they wide awake for four days
Ha , Im G-entleman , lets get re-aquainted
am Andre Benjamin

used to cruise the used car lot , put chrome on the truck
used to play the block like that
used to carry knots like that
Now got black cards , good credit and such

Hey , ya chick shop at the mall
Comin back with Birkin bags
Your chick is like , what type of purse is that
You from the era where snitchin is the shit
go to parties to party with nice girls


Jay-Z , what can young motherfucka tell me
About the LAPD , about the air that we breathe
Nothin , nada , zero , zilch
want tits for fun , you want tits for milk
Im all leather and silk , your fuckin t-shirt look like quilt
Playground king , climb the monkey bars that built
Thirtys the new twenty , Phantoms the new Bentley
Nigga , dont tempt me , Ill bury you up in Tempe
And if catch ghost rider , tie him to tree , gasoline like the lighter
Burn , you motherfuckin fighta , treat you like George Bush treat Al-Qaeda
This is Guantanamo , think Im ho , made the honor roll , mixed with Geronimo
Before this mic will pass , learn how to wipe your nose before you wipe your ass

Heres mix to make you move , smooth enough to soothe
Slow and lower you can go inside bassed up groove ( So funk it ! )
Its gotta be , aint no need to discuss it
( Yo Doc ! ) finna kick this shit , alright ! ( Alright , then bust it ! )

Rhymes created by the Doc , most definitely down !
could be bitten by this brother with some bad ass brown
It aint no joke , he needs some scope
Cause his breath is ( cold ! ) dope
As he talks can smell it , and Im seeing the smoke
Thats the bad breath bandit , you know whats in store
Stay away cause they breath will knock you ( to the floor ! )
That boy is ( rough ! ) de soda ( tough ! ) dont understand
Tests his breath inside his palm , and burned his hand !
Hes tucks destroyer , Listerine killer
cavity employer , yuck-mouth filler
( Say man , you bullshit ! ) no , thats fact Fresh
wish Velamints could take his breath away
But hes . . always in effect , smelling like dead vermin
Honking the bitches with his firewalls burning
Winch his witch as curl , just as funky as well
mean he has little woman that can match his smell ( Yes ! )
He has girlfriend , this is not pretend
She uses deodorant to spray for men
( Scratch and sniff wallpaper all over the house )
Aww shit ! ( Yeah boy , thats what Im talking about )
They need ten bars of soap , three boxes of Tide
To make them presentable to go outside
Now my story is true , and my opinion candid
But that is my tale of the bad breath bandit

[ The . . ] But you know , that aint even half of the shit
[ Fresh : ] Man , whats up ?
[ The . . ] This bitch who stay around the way , you know her !
[ Fresh : ] Yeah ?
[ The . . ] Yall want to talk about her ?
[ Fresh : ] Bust it !
[ Dr . Rock : ] Oh kick her ass , man

Lets talk about girl whos bonafide witch !
Name is Tammy , better known as bitch !
The boys in the hood all treat her like liquor
Quick is the way they pass her around and then stick her
Im not saying she minds , shes first class skeezer
Always on the jock , but only if hes uhh . .
Man with the money and the looks to show
( So you saying shes witch ? ) yeah Tammys material whore
Youre getting laid , if you can rock cross-fader
You got the bank , to make the bitch wholl get paid
Tagging Tammys process like when you use computer
Use her and do her like they did in the old days ( Shoot her ! )
whore and she knows it , yeah the knowledge is there
So they say that shes slutty and she tell them she dont care
But yall Im keeping my clear , even though she is pretty
( Cause we only use Tammy for guest to the city ) right on !

[ The . . ] But bust this , Tammy aint the only fucked-up freak in the city
[ Dr . Rock : ] Well who else , man ?
[ The . . ] Aww , come on Rock , you know her now , You know her
[ Dr . Rock : ] Seabiscuit breath , right ?
[ The . . ] Yeah , thats her
[ Dr . Rock : ] Yo ! Go on ! Bust it homes !

You stand around the bitch and your nose turns white
You ever thought about what Big Birds shit smells like ?
Well , you take that aroma , multiply it times two
And you think about Sue ( Sour-smelling Sue ! )
Shes girl that has the power to kill fresh flower
Rock smelled the whore and said ( Damn that bitch is sour ! )
Now , dont judge , mean thats not what Im thinking
People do what they want , and guess she like stinking
But whatever the deal , think someone should call Guiness
Cause this is kicking scent that fucks up Ks tennis shoes
And dress , dress it fresh to impress
She really ought to be embarrassed because that girl is mess
If you ever see her , youll duck and cover
She looks like your sister but smells like your brother
And since they tell me Trey , honestly phrase :
let her know that she reminded me of the Gunsmoke days
But it aint no ( thing ) if she stink shell ( sing )
But to me its like she needs little ( Irish Spring )
You ought to know what Im saying , hope made myself clear
About the three ass whores , but Troll Im out of here

Yo yo yo , these three people make me so sick that gotta go 1988 on it
Tammy your momma aint got no legs be talking about
aint gonna stand for this . . Ha ha ha ha !

Boy you sick man ! You sick ! Yeah yeah

Yo man ! got story from 1988 , check it out
Sue , you got so much butter on your teeth
That when you brush your teeth you have to use butter knife !
Ha ha ha ha !

Get ready for the king , here come , now check this out
Sour smelling Sue got so much dirt in her ear
That she can grow potatoes , Ha ha ha ha !
If you was born in the 80s then Im probably your papa
Cause times out of 10 fucked your mama
times out of 10 she gave me drama
But , fuck that shit , Im all about the dollar

When you see me in the streets you can call me daddy
When you go see your mama know hit that fatty
Back in the day , before she got ratty
, had her ass in the back of my Caddy
And , you know done it , Imma keep it 100
Back when she had more ass than stomach
Back , before her looks started to plummet
She would call me everynight , beggin she want it
would go pick her up , then dick her up
Then stick her up , for some gas bucks
For some lunch money , and some fast food
Nigga was pimp before Nigga With Attitude
And when you picture that know you wanna get your gat
Understand atomic dog always get the cat
And if young motherfuckers aint feelin that
wish she can open up , and put ya back

[ Hook : . . ] ( Ice Cube )

Clock at slave , and be half man

Gotta serve ya food that might give you cancer
Cuz my son doesnt take no for an answer
Now pay taxes that you never give me back
What about diapers , bottles , and similac
Do have to sell me whole lotta crack
For decent shelter and clothes on my back ?
Or should just wait for help from Bush
Or Jesse Jackson , and Operation PUSH
If you ask me the whole thing needs douche
Massengill what the hell crack will sell in the neighborhood
To the corner house bitches
Miss Parker , little Joe and Todd Bridges
Or anybody that he know
So copped me bird , better known as kilo
Now everybody know went from po to nigga that got dough
So now you put the feds against me
Cause couldnt follow the plan of the presidency
never get love again
But blacks are too fuckin broke to be republican
Now remember used to be cool
Till stopped fillin out my W-2
Now senators are gettin high
And your plan against the ghetto backfired
So now you got pep talk
But sorry , this is our only room to walk
Cause we dont want drug push
But bird in the hand is worth more than the bush

Tell the politicians , the hustlers : live and let live ( yeah )
Tell the politicians , the hustlers : live and let live ( yeah )
Only three short years after the 1965 Watts Riots
And the death of Malcolm

Intro : Little Russ , Ice Cube

[ Story-teller ] Once upon time , in the black part of the city
[ Young kid ] Yo , yo you better get out of here man , 5-0

[ Russ ] Yo Ice Cube , man
[ Cube ] Whassup man ?
[ Russ ] Why you . . .
[ Cube ] Whassup ?
[ Russ ] Yo Ice Cube man , why you always kickin the shit about the bitches
And the niggas ? Why dont you kick some shit about the kids , man ? The
Fuckin kids ? !
[ Cube ] Word

Verse One : Ice Cube

Little boys and girls , they all love me
Come sit on the lap of I-C
And let me tell ya story or two
About punk-ass nigga knew
Named Jack , he wasnt that nimble , wasnt that quick
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick
Ran up the street cause he was piping hot
Met bitch named Jill on the bus stop
Dropped line or two , and he had the ho
At that type of shit hes pro
So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch lil nap
Dumb bitch , gave him the claps
Then he had to go see Dr . Bombay
Got shot in the ass , and he was on his way
To make some money , why not ?
Down on Sesame Street , the dope spot
There he saw the lady who lived in shoe
Sold dope out the front , but in back , marijuana grew
For the man that was really important
Who lived down the street in Air Jordan
Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes
Drove 500 sittin on Lorenzoes
He broke out , Little Bo Peep , smoked out
Saw , her and her friends sellin sheepskins

[ Little Bo Peep ] Yo yo got them sheepskins
Yo , my empty sheepskins
Yo baby , whats up with that ?

Hickory dickory dock , it was twelve oclock
Cinderella aint home must be givin up the cock
dont doubt it , she is kind of freaky of course
Had fight with Snow White , she was fuckin her dwarfs
Saw fight over colors , too
Red Riding Hood , and Little Boy Blue
bad influence ? Yo dont know
But Ice Cubell tell the kids how the story should go

Interlude : Little Russ

Yeah money , thats it , yeah money , thats it
This is Little Russ in the house
Rock that shit homey , rock that shit !

Verse Two : Ice Cube

Humpty Dumpty sat on wall
With joint , drinkin some 8-ball
Three little pigs in Coup de Ville
Lookin for , the wolf to kill
Theyre fucked up and they want revenge
Them and Humpty used to be friends
Now theyre enemies cause hes traitor
Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him
Cinderella hoeing for the fellas
And Mister Rogers is gettin mighty jealous
Of the cash that the pigs were makin
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon
Cause Mister Rogers found out quick
That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits
They said that the motherfuckin wolf was next
So Mister Rogers better watch his step
So he let the wolf know
Were gonna fuck up the pigs , and take their ho
Cause Cinderella is much too fast
Before twelve , givin up ass
Double barrels all loaded and cocked
As soon as they show , they gonna get popped
They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em
Little Boy Blue is up front givin orders
Little did they know Cinderella was fink
She called the cops and got thrown in the clink
bad influence ? Yo , dont know
But Ice Cubell tell the kids how the stories should go

Outro : Little Russ , Ice Cube

[ Cube ] Aiyyo man was that dope enough for you ?
[ Russ ] Yeah you aight , you in the house
We outta here , seeeee-yaaaaa
[ Cube ] Yeah you better go home before whoop your little bad ass

[ Barney Rubble ] Some bedtime story huh ?
[ Bugs Bunny ] Its nice place to visit , but wouldnt wanna live here

[ Andrew Dice Clay ] Ay , good ol Mother Goose , remember her ? fucked her
Yo nigga , lets go scoop up some of these hoes at the Paradise , man
Hey man , ah Im engaged now , man
What ?
Im engaged
To that bitch ?
Aw man , dont be talkin about my woman like that
Oh , now youre gon trip on me
Wait , wait , hold up , hold up

How you gon go and put ho before me ?
When Im the one that helped your broke ass on the streets
Damn , Im starvin , what you got to eat ?
Im short , need place to sleep
Oh , but amnesia , that damn skeezer
Made you forget who was down witcha
thought birds of feather flock together
And dont damn thing change but the weather
But now know the real , guess had it all wrong
We used to hit the Ides until the shit was all gone
Where was she when you needed niggas off your ass
And whod you come to get to go blast ?
Not that once-a month-bleedin , always on her knees
Suckin every Tom , Dick and Harry like berry
seen her with trick at the Motel
And you still tryin to get that bitch Afro Fix
She got you by the nuts , playin with your wiener
Wrapped around her finger when the last time you seen her
Well , when you do , bust her lip
And if you dont , youse bitch
So sit down when you piss , muthafucka

( Its shame , but it aint no thang to me ) ] Deadly Threat

The bitch got you gone , talkin on phone
Tellin muthafuckas when you see me , its on
But little do he know that she zero
And Im still her favorite superhero
See , got the 411 on ho
Just like was tellin you before
Youre just piece of the mission
Guess where her lips been ?
told you dont be kissin , but you dont listen
Yeah , Jaws ( Jaws ) Jaws the only ho ever saw
That could suck basketball through straw
She dont like niggas with Nissan trucks
Unless they got the monster bumps
Thats right , honey , bunnys money-hungry
And shell frame ya , shes out to getcha
Get the picture , cause the bitchll
Take you for long-ass ride like the hitcher
So dont be surprised if they find you in ditch
With your guts hangin out lookin like Top Ramen
And when see the bitch , Im bombin
Cause shes false tenderony , plus tossed balony
And she aint your home , shes ho
Dont put ho before the homie

( Hey yo bitch , you better tell em ) ] Ice Cube

Whos wearin the pants , whos wearin the pants , nigga ?
If you ask me , think that her dick is bigger
Than your little dick , and Im tellin you , Jay
The bitch got you locked down like Pelicans Bay
Now told you if you fuck with the ho
Shes guaranteed to have you trippin
And me and you set-trippin
told my muthafuckin crew
To kidnap the ho , and they came back with you
cant fade nigga thats bitch-made
Kool-Aid pumpin , tell bitch somethin
Shell have your ass cookin dinner
While shes lettin every nigga in her hood run up in her
Got you runnin like Bruce Ginner , and the ho be
Pussy-whippin your ass like Toby
Now you act like you dont know me
Only markll put ho before the homies

Word this muthafucka is different
Yeah
Tell me your secret
Not just any secret
Just answer one question for me , baby
Do you love me ?
love you
Very , very , very , very much
Baby
Can come pick you up and take you shoppin ?
Spend all my money . . .
love you
love you

Dont put ho before the homie
" Ahonetwo , ahonetwo , like it . . . "

Im chocolate like bar but my name is not Roseanne
My skin has pigment , reminiscent of tan
plan to grow dreads but first nappy fro
The longer the hair , the easier to scare foe
It grows from my head until it covers up my face
People look and stare when walk into the place
This is just taste from the Funky Human Being
Aint no misbehavin , aint no use for ravin
Surrounded by the people who would stab me in the back
My skin is really brown even though its labeled black
Sometimes wear cap , and sometimes wear bandanas
Forbidden in . . but wore one in Atlanta
chiseled up sculpture to complement my culture
Thoughts of silly Nubians is prone to give me ulcers
Hangin with the brothers who are tribal in their ways
For this is how like to spend my days , and it pays
To steal groovy sample form the archives
Use my mental staff to eliminate apartheid
Still gather papes like my man Malcom Forbes
Ponderin my life as look into my orbs


love the shade of green like my brother Billy Bixby
utilize sample that salvaged from the 60s cause Im picky
My meal must appeal to me like Morris
Far too many fraudulent opponents in the forest
fall into the Gap when need to purchase clothes
Easy on the fads cause the posers always pose
suppose they will bite , theyll try not to show it
came very plain and then feelin rather loaded
ditched all the beads cause my needs seem to differ
Me and CM-P are like the Gil and the Skipper
He will use his clippers to give himself fade
give my fro sheen with smidgen of Pomade
laid in the shade and greeted mixel place
With rhythm and rhyme and he said that its twist
From the ordinary everyday continual assumption that RnB and rap makes winner
Guess whos comin through for dinner
native-like brother with the passive little style
That most certainly will smother
Suicidal rhymes with apocalyptic tunes
will drink seltzer while you dabble with the booze
And giggle when see ya liver shrivel to prune
Im the Funky Human Being not monkey or coon
Assume that the style is Funkadelic in the 90s
Del is livin phat as leave foe behind me

" Well shut this motherfucker DOWN ! " ( 2X )

Yo , this is B-Real from Cypress Hill
Kickin it with the motherfuckin Lench Mob
Showin yo ass , that you aint got no class

Everytime see you ( whassup ) you always on mission
Youre up too early in the mornin to go fishin
Wishin you can catch you somebody slippin
So you can sell his shit , and go get you hit
When you need to be at home with your god damn children
Thats why your landlord wants you out the buildin
Cause you havent paid your rent in six months
You got rats and roaches and your kidsve got the mumps
Cause you like to spend your checks on bumps
saw your little boys eatin oatmeal lumps
My oh my , wish you was my father
Cause Id take your ass out and wouldnt even bother
Tellin them did it yeah fool did it
Pops kept smokin so had to end that bullshit
This aint story bout kid from broken home
Its all about son , who father that was gone
So if youre out there and youre lookin for blast
Imma blast cause you aint got no class

Chorus : B-Real

Aint got no class . . ( Stucky Mack )
Aint got no class . . ( Stuck-y Mack )
Aint got no class . . ( Stucky Mack )
Aint got no class . . ( Stuck-y Mack )

In my neighborhood , theres girl named Sonya
For hit and some ( ? ? ) youre guaranteed to bone her
The funky-ass aroma , comin from her crouch
see why + Mama Said Knock You Out +
Now this is shame , to seen girl look this way
been everywhere , aint it only in , .
Not only do see em , always try to greet em
say do you have some kids ? ( Hell yeah ! ) Feed em
Cause remember one thing that Mom Duke told me
" Never let motherfuckin kid be , hongry "
Went into my pockets , and got twenty dollar bill
said , " Go buy your motherfuckin kids Happy Meal "
And followed her to Mickey Ds and made sure she bought the shit
And if she wouldnta man swear to God woulda hurt the bitch
Threw her ass in the ditch where the crackhead at
Cause the bitch , aint got no class

Chorus : B-Real

Aint got no class . . ( Stucky Mack )
Aint got no class . . ( Stuck-y Mack )
Aint got no class . . ( Stucky Mack )
No the bitch aint got no class ( Stucky-fuckin Mack )

Its damn shame
Smoked up her kids money
Boy cant even eat

You come home fucked up , with the basshead calls
Kids got no lunch money cause you smoked it all up
You get your first period , stomach just growlin
Look outside , the teacher think that its thunderin
But its not thunder its your little boys tummy
Now dont it make you feel like motherfuckin dummy ?
He cant feed hisself , and his moms cant either
Basehead parents ; man we dont really need em
Especially if they smokin and the home is broken
At nutrition time , my niggas be like jokin
Sayin that Im bummy , Im thinkin bout my tummy
Im hungry as FUCK and moms smoked up our bucks
Now gotta do her with slug ( Stucky Mack )
Now gotta do her like thug ( buck buck buck ! )
Now gotta go , shoot up the drug spots
Mr . Police , could you please take my mug shot
Three hots in the cot for my ass
Cause my moms , aint got no class

Chorus : B-Real

Aint got no class . . ( Stucky Mack )
Aint got no class . . ( Stuck-y Mack )
Aint got no class . . ( Stucky Mack )
No moms aint got no class
Aint got no class . . ( Stucky Mack )
Aint got no class . . ( Stucky-fuckin Mack )
Aint got no class . . ( Stucky Mack )
No moms aint got no class

Aint that right J-Dee ?
She need to get on with her sorry ass
Beitch !

" Well shut this motherfucker DOWN ! " ( 4X )
Now take my bitch , she wont complain about shit
Because shes my ho , she dont belong to trick
So when you fuck her , and give her all your cash

Now stupid little bitches get tossed
If they dont realize Im the motherfucking boss
Come on down and get your ass pinched
And if you talk shit get your ass lynched
Cause Im the the the the the

Ice Cube , nigga thats bigga than nut
Cause bitch is bitch is ho is slut

You say how can call women bitch
It aint nothing but word like shit
Aint no slipping in my motherfucking pimping
And all bitches aint women
You come home and get smooth cussed out
You gotta bitch with foul-ass mouth
Scared to tripp her with left hook
Youz bitch in my book , bitch

My nigga Jinx made the mix
So punk-ass motherfucking bitches get the 86

With my boy Too $ hort , see he quick to grab bitch by the throat
And slam her ass , cram her ass with fat dick , cause shes trick bitch

Ill take fat bitch , and stick my dick right in
Her big fat ass , shell make me cum again
Im mack daddy bitch , fuck her friend
saw your homegirl , she said whats up with us
said nothing , fucked her on tour bus
She got it good too , dicked down on the floor
The bitch was fine , but the pussy aint good as yours

She straggler , struggler , straight salome smuggler
Everytime see the bitch , shes looking uglier
And if you got trick-ass on your left , sitting there with dick on her breath
Last night she sucked my dick , now shes kissing little man
Wont he suck my dick and lets cut out the middle man
And if you have never heard of me , yous bitch
It aint but word to me

Man Fuck these hoes man , ya know
Nappy ass bitch ass tramp ass slutty ass ho

Female voice :
Ill stop calling ya , Beyotch ( echo )

Always carrying bank , but fooled the bitch
Cause all she ever got was to drool on my dick
Ice Cube will slap ho for the fuck of it
Just like me and thats some real shit
Bitch got bold with her loud ass mouth
Tough ass bitch got knocked out
You know bitch aint nothing but word to me
Some of you punks are just scared to see
If you could call that bitch bitch you would
And if you cant , you probably should
Im spitting game to you mark ass lames
On how how to get bitch and treat the bitch like shit
You cant buy love , all pimps know that
Its all about the way old Short Dogg macks
Dont hold the bitch hand or walk side by side
Go first class everytime you fly
Shell go Greyhound , and just meet you there
Im just an ice cold hard ass Oakland player
You want to tongue kiss bitch , it figures
introduce you to my homeboy Richard
Also known by his nickname Dick , now lets tongue kiss bitch

like big butts , so let it be known to the public
bust rap or two and the bitches love it
Im only out for one thing so hate me , aint the one so dont try to fade me
dont wear too much gold cause its tacky
bust Raider hat t-shirt and khakis
See lot of hoes in freaky clothes everyday
So talk to em in any ol can way
See bitch need nigga to coach em
So grab my dick and smoothly approach em
say hi , and Im really kind of pitched
If they ignore me then say yo freak bitch
Give up the number hardly , well have slumber party
You see Ill fuck you to death and then Ill dump the body
Cause Im nigga thats bigger than crew or gang
And when it comes to bitches Im out for only one thang
Yo , bitch aint nothing but word to me , $ hort
Down at the best spot
Its me and JD and they sellin more birds than pet shop .
The spots hot and everybody nervous
Thats when the blue car served us
Oh why did fools have to let loose ?
Heard six pops from deuce deuce .
Big Tom had to push us
13 niggas runnin straight to the bushes
For they gats so they could draw down
But why motherfucker like me have to fall down ?
Not knowin why dropped out
Fuck it , still cant afford to get popped out
So now gotta jet
Only ran one block , but my shirt soakin wet
Tryin to see if we got em
Looked down and my sweatshirts red at the bottom .
Didnt panic but still looked cracked out
Yelled to the homies then blacked out

Woke up in the back of trey
On my way , to MLK ;
Thats the county hospital , jack
Where niggas die over little scratch .
Sittin in the trauma center
In my back is where the bullet entered
" Yo , nurse , Im gettin kind of warm ! "
Bitch still made me fill out the fuckin form
Coughin up blood on my hands and knees
Then heard , " Freeze , nigger ! Dont move ! "
Yo , didnt do thing
Dont wanna go out like my man Rodney King
Still got gaffled
Internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel
Now Im handcuffed
Being asked information on my gang affiliation
" dont bang , rock the good rhymes
And Im victim of neighborhood crime . "

need to see MD
And yall mothafuckers giving me the third degree ?
Look at the waiting room
Its filled to the rim like the county jail day room
Nobody gettin help
Since we poor
The hospitald move slow
Now Im layed out
People steppin over me to get closer to the TV
Just like piece of dog shit
Now will die on this nappy ass carpet ?
One hour done passed
Done watched two episodes of * * * ,
And when Im almost through
They call my name and put me in ICU .
Halfway dead
No respect and handcuffed to the bed
Now the drama starts
Cause the bullet must be just hair from my heart .
Then begin the ass kissin
Just to get looked at by overworked physician
Had the chills , but my temperatures hundred-and three
Only got band-aid and an IV
Thats when start cussin
Police steady askin me who did the bustin

Why , oh why , cant get help ?
Cause Im black , gots to go for self
Too many black bodies the hospital housin
So at 10 . . was Audi 5000 .
Gangster
Slow that shit down
Yeah
Who wanna ride with this ?

We can ride all day everyday

Youll be high all day everyday

My energy holds it down like the NFC
Im going thorough thru your borough
Wit my Raider jacket and my jheri curl , gangstas rule the world
On the west , nevertheless , W-S
We got the bomb and you niggas got the stress

You couldnt have said it no better homeboy
With my automatic toy , kill and destroy
These buster ass critics from the N-Y
Dont they know that be from the I-N
My peeps play for keeps , deep crews pay dues
By murder ones and twos , rip riders and Damus
Choose to stay gangsta , you never ever ran us
We bustin clips like bananas , sportin colored bandanas

[ WC }

Dusty ass New York critic killer
Dumping and pumping the motherfuckin lead in their chest

Fuck all the critics in the N-Y
Tryin to get an East hip-hop monopoly
But Ive been writing gangsta shit since 83
When yall was still scared to use profanity
Now everybody wanna run and go and get triggers
And blame it on these West Coast seven-figure niggas
Just because we made it real niggas got to deal
hope blood aint got to spill , kill

Its like the battle of the sexes
You wanna treat us like bitches cos were platinum when we flex this
With mic in hand , fans in the stands
We make mill-ion from California to Japan , bitch
Went overseas , seen Ds how we done it

This West Coast gangsta shit got it crackin , or we jackin
Packin ninas and sellin out arenas , niggas

You make me wanna holler , throw up both my Dubs
And roll these niggas up , got to beat em
When see me , T-Roller cut off his scrotum

Fuck your backpacks and your wack ass raps

Fuck your baggy jeans , fuck your magazines

Got to the house , my pockets got fat , see
Crack the safe , got the money and the jewellry
Three weeks later , Im at the P-A

Damn ( oh shit ! ) didnt know lucked out
Struck out , gotta get the fuck out
Packed my bags and tried to hit the door when
The ol bitch down the street mustve turned me in
Cos the feds was out there ten deep
got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
think back when was robbin my own kind
The police didnt pay it no mind
But when start robbin the white folks
Now Im in the pen wit the soap-on a-rope
said it before and Ill still taught it
Every motherfucker with colour is most wanted
