THE FIRST FORTY - NINE STORIES 

by 
ERNEST HEMINGWAY 


PREFACE 

THERE is not much to say about these stories .  The first four 
are the last ones I have written .  The others follow in the 
order in which they were originally published .  

The first one I wrote was Up in Michigan ,  written in 
Paris in 1921 .  The last was Old Man at the Bridge ,  cabled 
from Barcelona in April of 1938 .  

I wrote The Killers ,  To - day Is Friday ,  Ten Indians "  ,  
part of Fiesta ,  and the first third of To Have and Have Not 
in Madrid .  It was always a good place for working .  So was 
Paris ,  and so were Key West ,  Florida ,  in the cool months ;  the 
ranch ,  near Cooke City ,  Montana ;  Kansas City ;  Chicago ;  
Toronto ,  and Havana ,  Cuba .  

Some other places were not so good ,  but maybe we were 
not so good when we were in them .  

There are many kinds of stories in this book .  I hope that 
you will find some that you like .  Reading them over ,  the ones 
I liked the best ,  outside of those that have achieved some 
notoriety so that school teachers include them in story col -  
lections that their pupils have to buy in story courses ,  and 
you are always faintly embarrassed to read them and wonder 
whether you really wrote them or did you maybe hear them ,  
somewhere ,  are The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber ,  
In Another Country 5  ,  Hills Like White Elephants ,  A Way 
Youll Never Be ,  The Snows of Kilimanjaro ,  A Clean ,  
Well - Lighted Place ,  and a story called The Light of the 
World ,  which nobody else ever liked .  There are some others 
too .  Because if you did not like them you would not publish 
them .  

In going where you have to go ,  and doing what you have 
to do ,  and seeing what you have to see ,  you dull and blunt 
the instrument you write with .  But I would rather have it 
bent and dulled and know I had to put it on the grindstone 
again and hammer it into shape and put a whetstone to it ,  
and know that I had something to write about ,  than to have

it bright and shining and nothing to say ,  or smooth and well 
oiled in the closet ,  but unused .  < 

Now it is necessary to get to the grindstone again .  I would 
like to live long enough to write three more novels and 
twenty - five more stories .  I know some pretty good ones .

THE SHORT HAPPY LIFE OF 
FRANCIS MACOMBER 

IT was now lunch time and they were all sitting under the 
double green fly of the dining tent pretending thit nothing 
had happened .  

Will you have lime juice or lemon squash ?  5 Macomber 
asked .  

Til have a gimlet /  Robert Wilson told him .  

Til have a gimlet too .  I need something ,  Macombers 
wife said .  

I suppose its the thing to do /  Macomber agreed .  Tell 
him to make three gimlets .  

The mess boy had started them already ,  lifting the bottles 
out of the canvas cooling bags that sweated wet in the wind 
that blew through the trees that shaded the tents .  

What had I ought to give them ?  Macomber asked .  

A quid would be plenty /  Wilson told him .  You dont 
want to spoil them .  

Will the headman distribute it ?  

Absolutely .  

Francis Macomber had ,  half an hour before ,  been carried 
to his tent from the edge of the camp in triumph on the arms 
and shoulders of the cook ,  the personal boys ,  the skinner and 
the porters .  The gun - bearers had taken no part in the 
demonstration .  When the native boys put him down at the 
door of his tent ,  he had shaken all their hands ,  received their 
congratulations ,  and then gone into the tent and sat on the 
bed until his wife came in .  She did not speak to him when 
she came in and he left the tent at once to wash his face and 
hands in the portable wash basin outside and go over to the 
dining tent to sit in a comfortable canvas chair in the breeze 
and the shade .  

Mrs .  Macomber looked at Wilson quickly .  She was an 
extremely handsome and well - kept woman of the beauty and 
social position which had ,  five years before ,  commanded five

thousand dollars as the price of endorsing ,  with photographs ,  
a beauty product which she had never used .  She had been 
married to Francis Macomber for eleven years .  

He is a good lion ,  isnt he ?  Macomber said .  His wife 
looked at him now .  She looked at both these men as though 
she had never seen them before .  

One ,  Wilson ,  the white hunter ,  she knew she had never 
truly seen before .  He was about middle height with sandy 
hair ,  a stubby moustache ,  a very red face and extremely cold 
blue eyes with faint white wrinkles at the corners that grooved 
merrily when he smiled .  He smiled at her now and she 
looked away from his face at the way his shoulders sloped in 
the loose tunic he wore with the four big cartridges held in 
loops where the left breast pocket should have been ,  at his 
big brown hands ,  his old slacks ,  his very dirty boots ,  and back 
to his red face again .  She noticed where the baked red of his 
face stopped in a white line that marked the circle left by his 
Stetson hat that hung now from one of the pegs of the tent pole .  

Well ,  heres to the lion ,  5 Robert Wilson said .  He smiled at 
her again and ,  not smiling ,  she looked curiously at her 
husband .  

Francis Macomber was very tall ,  very well built if you did 
not mind that length of bone ,  dark ,  his hair cropped like an 
oarsman ,  rather thin - lipped ,  and was considered handsome .  
He was dressed in the same sort of safari clothes that Wilson 
wore except that his were new ,  he was thirty - five years old ,  
kept himself very fit ,  was good at court games ,  had a number 
of big -  game fishing records ,  and had just shown himself ,  very 
publicly ,  to be a coward .  

Heres to the lion ,  he said .  I cant ever thank you for 
what you did .  

Margaret ,  his wife ,  looked away from him and back to 
Wilson .  

Lets not talk about the lion ,  5 she said .  

Wilson looked over at her without smiling and now she 
smiled at him .

Its been a very strange day /  she said .  Hadnt you ought 
to put your hat on even under the canvas at noon ?  You told 
me that ,  you know .  

Might put it on ,  said Wilson .  

You know you have a very red face ,  Mr .  Wilson ,  she told 
him and smiled again .  

Drink /  said Wilson .  

I dont think so /  she said .  Francis drinks a great deal ,  but 
his face is never red .  3 

Its red to - day /  Macomber tried a joke .  

No /  said Margaret .  Its mine thats red to - day .  But Mr .  
Wilsons is always red .  

Must be racial /  said Wilson .  I say ,  you wouldnt like to 
drop my beauty as a topic ,  would you ?  

Ive just started on it .  

Lets chuck it /  said Wilson .  

Conversation is going to be so difficult /  Margaret said .  

Dont bo silly ,  Margot /  her husband said .  

No difficulty /  Wilson said .  Got a damn fine lion .  

Margot looked at them both and they both saw that she 
was going to cry .  Wilson had seen it coming for a long time 
and he dreaded it .  Macomber was past dreading it .  

I wish it hadnt happened .  Oh ,  I wish it hadnt happened /  
she said and started for her tent .  She made no noise of crying 
but they could see that her shoulders were shaking under the 
rose - coloured ,  sun - proofed shirt she wore .  

Women upset /  said Wilson to the tall man .  Amounts to 
nothing .  Strain on the nerves and one thing n another .  

No /  said Macomber .  I suppose that I rate that for the 
rest of my life now .  

Nonsense .  Lets have a spot of the giant killer /  said Wilson .  
Forget the whole thing .  Nothing to it anyway .  

We might try /  said Macomber .  I wont forget what you 
did for me though .  

Nothing /  said Wilson .  All nonsense .  

So they sat there in the shade where the camp was pitched

under some wide - topped acacia trees with a boulder - strewn 
cliff behind them ,  and a stretch of grass that ran to the bank 
of a boulder - filled stream in front with forest beyond it ,  and 
drank their just - cool lime drinks and avoided one anothers 
eyes while the boys set the table for lunch .  Wilson could 
tell that the boys all knew about it now and When he saw 
Macombers personal boy looking curiously at his master 
while he was putting dishes on the table he snapped at him 
in Swahili .  The boy turned away with his face blank .  

What were you telling him ?  Macomber asked .  

Nothing .  Told him to look alive or Id see he got about 
fifteen of the best .  

Whats that ?  Lashes ?  

Its quite illegal ,  Wilson said .  Youre supposed to fine 
them .  

Do you still have them whipped ?  

Oh ,  yes .  They could raise a row if they chose to complain .  
But they dont .  They prefer it to the fines .  

How strange! said Macomber .  

Not strange ,  really ,  Wilson said .  Which would you 
rather do ?  Take a good birching or lose your pay ?  

Then he felt embarrassed at asking it and before 
Macomber could answer he went on ,  We all take a beating 
eVery day ,  you know ,  one way or another .  

This was no better .  Good God ,  he thought .  I am a 
diplomat ,  arent I ?  

Yes ,  we take a beating ,  said Macomber ,  still not looking 
at hini .  Im awfully sorry about that lion business .  It 
doesnt have to go any further ,  does it ?  I mean no one will 
hear about it ,  will they ?  

You mean will I tell it at the Mathaiga Club ?  Wilson 
looked at him now coldly .  He had not expected this .  So hes 
a bloody four - letter man as well as a bloody coward ,  he 
thought .  I rather liked him too until to - day .  But how is one 
to know about an American ?  

No ,  5 said Wilson .  Im a professional hunter .  We never talk 



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 13 

about our clients .  You can be quite easy on that .  Its 
supposed to be bad form to ask us not to talk though .  

tL had decided now that to break would be much easier .  
He would eat ,  then ,  by himself and could read a book v / ith 
his meals .  They would eat by themselves .  He would see 
them through the safari on a very formal basis what was it 
the French called it ?  Distinguished consideration and it 
would be a damn sight easier than having to go through this 
emotional trash .  Hed insult him and make a good clean 
break .  Then he could read a book with his meals and hed 
still be drinking their whisky .  That was the phrase for it 
when a safari went bad .  You ran into another white hunter 
and you asked ,  c How is everything going ?  and he answered ,  
c Oh ,  Im still drinking their whisky ,  and you knew every -  
thing had gone to pot .  

Im sorry ,  Macomber said and looked at him with his 
American face that would stay adolescent until it became 
middle - aged ,  and Wilson noted his crew - cropped hair ,  fine 
eyes only faintly shifty ,  good nose ,  thin lips and handsome 
jaw .  Im sorry I didnt realize that .  There are lots of 
things I dont know .  

So what could he do ,  Wilson thought .  He was all ready to 
break it off quickly and neatly and here the beggar was 
apologizing after he had just insulted him .  He made one 
more attempt .  Dont worry about me talking ,  he said .  I 
have a living to make .  You know in Africa no woman ever 
misses her lion and no white man ever bolts .  

I bolted like a rabbit ,  Macomber said .  

Now what in hell were you going to do about a man who 
talked like that ,  Wilson wondered .  

Wilson looked at Macomber with his flat ,  blue ,  machine -  
gunners eyes and the other smiled back at him .  He had a 
pleasant smile if you did not notice how his eyes showed 
when he was hurt .  

Maybe I can fix it up on buffalo ,  he said .  Were after 
them next ,  arent we ?

c ln the morning if you like /  Wilson told him .  Perhaps he 
had been wrong .  This was certainly the way to take it .   / ou 
most certainly could not tell a damned thing about an 
American .  He was all for Macomber again .  If you could 
forget the morning .  But ,  of course ,  you couldnt .  The 
morning had been about as bad as they come .  

Here comes the Memsahib ,  he said .  She was walking 
over from her tent looking refreshed and cheerful and quite 
lovely .  She had a very perfect oval face ,  so perfect that you 
expected her to be stupid .  But she wasnt stupid ,  Wilson 
thought ,  no ,  not stupid .  

How is the beautiful red - faced Mr .  Wilson ?  Are you 
feeling better ,  Francis ,  my pearl ?  

Oh ,  much ,  said Macomber .  

Ive dropped the whole thing ,  she said ,  sitting down at 
the table .  What importance is there to whether Francis is 
any good at killing lions ?  Thats not his trade .  Thats Mr .  
Wilsons trade .  Mr .  Wilson is really very impressive killing 
anything .  You do kill anything ,  dont you ?  

Oh ,  anything ,  said Wilson .  Simply anything .  3 They 
are ,  he thought ,  the hardest in the world ;  the hardest ,  the 
cruellest ,  the most predatory and the most attractive and 
their men have softened or gone to pieces nervously as they 
have hardened .  Or is it that they pick men they can handle ?  
They cant know that much at the age they marry ,  he -  
thought .  He was grateful that he had gone through his educa -  
tion on American women before now because this was a very 
attractive one .  

Were going after buff in the morning ,  he told her .  

Im coming ,  she said .  

No youre not .  

Oh ,  yes ,  I am .  Maynt I ,  Francis ?  

Why not stay in camp ?  

Not for anything ,  she said .  I wouldnt miss something 
like to - day for anything .  

When she left ,  Wilson was thinking ,  when she went off to

cry she seemed a hell of a fine woman .  She seemed to 
understand ,  to realize ,  to be hurt for him and for herself and 
to k*now how things really stood .  She is away for twenty 
minutes and now she is back ,  simply enamelled in that 
American female cruelty .  They are the damnedest womeji .  
Really the clamnedest .  

Well put on another show for you to - morrow ,  Francis 
Macomber said .  

Youre not coming ,  Wilson said .  

Youre very mistaken ,  she told him .  And I want so to 
see you perform again .  You were lovely this morning .  That 
is if blowing things heads off is lovely .  

Heres the lunch ,  said Wilson .  Youre very merry ,  
arent you ?  

Why not ?  I didnt come out here to be dull .  

Well ,  it hasnt been dull ,  Wilson said .  He could see the 
boulders in the river and the high bank beyond with the 
trees and he remembered the morning .  

Oh ,  no /  she said .  Its been charming .  And to - morrow .  
You dont know how I look forward to to - morrow .  

Thats eland hes offering you ,  Wilson said .  

Theyre the big cowy things that jump like hares ,  arent 
they ?  

I suppose that describes them ,  Wilson said .  

Its very good meat ,  Macomber said .  

Did you shoot it ,  Francis ?  she asked .  

Yes .  

Theyre not dangerous ,  are they ?  

Only if they fall on you ,  Wilson told her .  

Im so glad .  

Why not let up on the bitchery just a little ,  Margot ,  
Macomber said ,  cutting the eland steak and putting some 
mashed potato ,  gravy and carrot on the down - turned fork 
that tined through the piece of meat .  

I suppose I could ,  she said ,  since you put it so 
prettily .

To - night well have champagne for the lion ,  Wilson said .  
Its a bit too hot at noon .  

Oh ,  the lion ,  Margot said .  Td forgotten the lion!  -  

So ,  Robert Wilson thought to himself ,  she is giving him a 
ride ,  isnt she ?  Or do you suppose thats her idea of putting 
up a good show ?  How should a woman act when she 
discovers her husband is a bloody coward ?  Shes damn cruel 
but theyre all cruel .  They govern ,  of course ,  and to govern 
one has to be cruel sometimes .  Still ,  Ive seen enough of 
their damn terrorism .  

Have some more eland ,  he said to her politely .  

That afternoon ,  late ,  Wilson and Macomber went out in 
the motor car with the native driver and the two gun - bearers .  
Mrs .  Macomber stayed in the camp .  It was too hot to go out ,  
she said ,  and she was going with them in the early morning .  
As they drove off Wilson saw her standing under the big 
tree looking pretty rather than beautiful in her faintly rosy 
khaki ,  her dark hair drawn back off her forehead and 
gathered in a knot low on her neck ,  her face as fresh ,  he 
thought ,  as though she were in England .  She waved to them 
as the car went off through the swale of high grass and 
curved around through the trees into the small hills of 
orchard bush .  

In the orchard bush they found a herd of impala ,  and 
leaving the car they stalked one old ram with long ,  wide -  
spread horns and Macomber killed it with a very creditable ,  
shot that knocked the buck down at a good two hundred yards 
and sent the herd off bounding wildly and leaping over one 
anothers backs in long ,  leg - drawn - up leaps as unbelievable 
and as floating as those one makes sometimes in dreams .  

That was a good shot ,  Wilson said .  Theyre a small 
target .  5 

Is it a worth - while head ?  Macomber asked .  

Its excellent ,  Wilson told him .  You shoot like that and 
youll have no trouble .  

Do you think well find buffalo to - morrow ?  5 



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 17 

Theres a good chance of it .  They feed out early in the 
morning and with luck we may catch them in the open .  

Id like to clear away that lion business /  Macomber said .  
Its not very pleasant to have your wife see you do somp .  
thing like that .  

I should think it would be even more unpleasant to do it ,  
Wilson thought ,  wife or no wife ,  or to talk about it having 
done it .  But he said ,  C I wouldnt think about that any more .  
Anyone could be upset by his first lion .  Thats all over .  

But that night after dinner and a whisky and soda by the 
fire before going to bed ,  as Francis Macomber lay on his cot 
with the mosquito bar over him and listened to the night 
noises it was not all over .  It was neither all over nor was it 
beginning .  It was there exactly as it happened with some 
parts of it indelibly emphasized and he was miserably 
ashamed at it .  But more than shame he felt cold ,  hollow 
fear in him .  The fear was still there like a cold slimy hollow 
in all the emptiness where once his confidence had been and 
it made him feel sick .  It was still there with him now .  

It had started the night before when he had wakened and 
heard the lion roaring somewhere up along the river .  It was 
a deep sound and at the end there were sort of coughing grunts 
that made him seem just outside the tent ,  and when Francis 
Macomber woke in the night to hear it he was afraid .  He 
could hear his wife breathing quietly ,  asleep .  There was no 
one to tell he was afraid ,  nor to be afraid with him ,  and ,  
lying alone ,  he did not know the Somali proverb that says 
a brave man is always frightened three times by a lion ;  when 
he first sees his track ,  when he first hears him roar and when 
he first confronts him .  Then while they were eating break -  
fast by lantern light out in the dining tent ,  before the sun 
was up ,  the lion roared again and Francis thought he was 
just at the edge of camp .  

Sounds like an old - timer ,  Robert Wilson said ,  looking up 
from his kippers and coffee .  Listen to him cough .  

Is he very close ?  



i$ HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 

A mile or so up the stream .  

Will we see him ?  5  

Well have a look .  

Does his roaring carry that far ?  It sounds as though he 
were right in camp .  5 

^Carries a hell of a long way ,  said Robert Wilson ,  c lts 
strange the way it carries .  Hope hes a shootable cat .  The 
boys said there was a very big one about here .  

If I get a shot ,  where should I hit him ,  Macomber asked ,  
to stop him ?  

In the shoulders ,  Wilson said .  In the neck if you can 
make it .  Shoot for bone .  Break him down .  

I hope I can place it properly ,  Macomber said .  

You shoot very well ,  Wilson told him .  Take your time .  
Make sure of him .  The first one in is the one that counts .  5 

What range will it be ?  

Cant tell .  Lion has something to say about that .  Dont 
shoot unless its close enough so you can make sure .  5 

At under a hundred yards ?  Macomber asked .  

Wilson looked at him quickly .  

Hundreds about right .  Might have to take him a bit 
under .  Shouldn 5 t chance a shot at much over that .  A 
hundreds a decent range .  You can hit him wherever you 
want at that .  Here comes the Memsahib .  

Good morning ,  5 she said .  Are we going after that lion ?  

As soon as you deal with your breakfast ,  5 Wilson said .  
How are you feeling ?  

Marvellous ,  5 she said .  Tm very excited .  5 

Til just go and see that everything is ready .  Wilson went 
off .  As he left the lion roared again .  

Noisy beggar ,  5 Wilson said .  Well put a stop to that .  

*What 5 s the matte* ,  Francis ?  5 his wife asked him .  

Nothing ,  5 Macomber said .  

Yes ,  there is ,  5 she said .  What are you upset about ?  5 

Nothing ,  5 he said .  

Tell me ,  5 she looked at him .  Dont you feel yvell ?  5 



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS M A C O M B E R 19 

Its that damned roaring ,  he said .  Its been going on all 
night ,  you know .  

f Why didnt you wake me ,  she said .  Td love to have 
heard it .  

Ive got to kill the damned thing ,  Macomber s~id ,  
miserably .  

Well ,  thats what youre out here for ,  isnt it ?  

Yes .  But Im nervous .  Hearing the thing roar gets on my 
nerves .  

Well ,  then ,  as Wilson said ,  kill him and stop his roaring /  

Yes ,  darling ,  said Francis Macomber .  It sounds easy ,  
doesnt it ?  

Youre not afraid ,  are you ?  

Of course not .  But Im nervous from hearing him roar 
all night .  

Youll kill him marvellously ,  she said .  I know you will .  
Im awfully anxious to see it .  

Finish your breakfast and well be starting .  

Its not light yet ,  she said .  This is a ridiculous hour .  

Just then the lion roared in a deep - chested moaning ,  sud -  
denly guttural ,  ascending vibration that seemed to shake the 
air and ended in a sigh and a heavy ,  deep - chested grunt .  

He sounds almost here ,  Macombers wife said .  

My God ,  said Macomber .  I hate that damned noise .  

Its very impressive .  

Impressive .  Its frightful .  

Robert Wilson came up then carrying his short ,  ugly ,  
shockingly big - bored  . 505 Gibbs and grinning .  

Come on ,  he said .  Your gun - bearer has your Springfield 
and the big gun .  Everythings in the car .  Have you solids ?  

Yes .  5 

Im ready ,  Mrs .  Macomber said .  

Must make him stop that racket ,  Wilson said .  You get in 
front .  The Memsahib can sit back here with me .  

They climbed into the motor car and ,  in the grey first day -  
light ,  moved off up the river through the trees .  Macomber

opened the breach of his rifle and saw he had metal - cased 
bullets ,  shut the bolt and put the rifle on safety .  He saw his 
hand was trembling .  He felt in his pocket for more cartridges 
ar*d moved his fingers over the cartridges in the loops of his 
tunic front .  He turned back to where Wilson sat in the rear 
seat of the doorless ,  box - bodied motor car beside his wife ,  
them both grinning with excitement ,  and Wilson leaned 
forward and whispered .  

See the birds dropping .  Means the old boy has left his 
kill .  

On the far bank of the stream Macomber could see ,  above 
the trees ,  vultures circling and plummeting down .  

Chances are hell come to drink along here /  Wilson 
whispered .  Before he goes to lay up .  Keep an eye out .  

They were driving slowly along the high bank of the stream 
which here cut deeply to its boulder - filled bed ,  and they 
wound in and out through big trees as they drove .  Macomber 
was watching the opposite bank when he felt Wilson take 
hold of his arm .  The car stopped .  

There he is ,  he heard the whisper .  Ahead and to the 
right .  Get out and take him .  Hes a marvellous lion .  

Macomber saw the lion now .  He was standing almost 
broadside ,  his great head up and turned toward them .  The 
earlymorning breeze that blew toward them was just stirring 
his dark mane ,  and the lion looked huge ,  silhouetted on the rise 
of bank in the grey morning light ,  his shoulders heavy ,  his 
barrel of a body bulking smoothly .  

How far is he ?  asked Macomber ,  raising his rifle .  

About seventy - five .  Get out and take him .  5 

Why not shoot from where I am ?  

You dont shoot them from cars ,  he heard Wilson saying 
in his ear .  Get out .  Hes not going to stay there all day .  

Macomber stepped out of the curved opening at the side 
of the front seat ,  on to the step and down on to the ground .  
The lion still stood looking majestically and coolly toward 
this object that his eyes only showed in silhouette ,  bulking 



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 21 

like some super - rhino .  There was no man smell carried 
toWard him and he watched the object ,  moving his great 
head a little from side to side .  Then watching the object ,  
not afraid ,  but hesitating before going down the bartk . to 
drink with such a thing opposite him ,  he saw aman figure 
detach itself from it and he turned his heavy head and 
swung away toward the cover of the trees as he heard a 
cracking crash and felt the slam of a  . 30 - 06 220 - grain solid 
bullet that bit his flank and ripped in sudden hot scalding 
nausea through his stomach .  He trotted ,  heavy ,  big - footed ,  
swinging wounded full - bellied ,  through the trees toward 
the tall grass and cover ,  and the crash came again to go 
past him ripping the air apart .  Then it crashed again and 
he felt the blow as it hit his lower ribs and ripped on 
through ,  blood sudden hot and frothy in his mouth ,  and he 
galloped toward the high grass where he could crouch and 
not be seen and make them bring the crashing thing close 
enough so he could make a rush and get the man that held it .  
Macomber had not thought how the lion felt as he got out 
of the car .  He only knew his hands were shaking and as he 
walked away from the car it was almost impossible for him to 
make his legs move .  They were stiff in the thighs ,  but he 
could feel the muscles fluttering .  He raised the rifle ,  sighted 
on the junction of the lions head and shoulders and pulled 
the trigger .  Nothing happened though he pulled until he 
thought his finger would break .  Then he knew he had the 
safety on and as he lowered the rifle to move the safety over 
he moved another frozen pace forward ,  and the lion seeing 
his silhouette now clear of the silhouette of the car ,  turned 
and started off at a trot ,  and ,  as Macomber fired ,  he heard 
a whunk that meant that the bullet was home ;  but the lion 
kept on going .  Macomber shot again and everyone saw the 
bullet throw a spout of dirt beyond the trotting lion .  He 
shot again ,  remembering to lower his aim ,  and they all 
heard the bullet hit ,  and the lion went into a gallop and was 
in the tall grass before he had the bolt pushed forward .

Macomber stood there feeling sick at his stomach ,  his 
hands that held the Springfield still cocked ,  shaking ,  and his 
wife and Robert Wilson were standing by him .  Beside him 
too ,  , were the two gun - bearers chattering in Wakamba .  

I .  hit him /  Macomber said .  I hit him twice .  

You gut - shot him and you hit him somewhere forward /  
Wilson said without enthusiasm .  The gun - bearers looked 
very grave .  They were silent now .  

You may have killed him ,  Wilson went on .  Well have 
to wait a while before we go in to find out .  

What do you mean ?  

Let him get sick before we follow him up .  

Oh ,  said Macomber .  

Hes a hell of a fine lion ,  Wilson said cheerfully .  Hes 
gotten into a bad place though .  

Why is it bad ?  

Cant see him until youre on him .  

Oh ,  said Macomber .  

Come on ,  said Wilson .  The Memsahib can stay here in 
the car .  Well go to have a look at the blood spoor .  

Stay here ,  Margot ,  Macomber said to his wife .  His 
mouth was very dry and it was hard for him to talk .  

Why ?  she asked .  

Wilson says to .  

Were going to have a look ,  Wilson said .  You stay here .  
You can see even better from here .  

All right .  

Wilson spoke in Swahili to the driver .  He nodded and 
said ,  Yes ,  Bwana .  

Then they went down the steep bank and across the 
stream ,  climbing over and around the boulders and up the 
other bank ,  pulling up by some projecting roots ,  and along it 
until they found where the lion had been trotting when 
Macomber first shot .  There was dark blood on the short 
grass that the gun - bearers pointed out with grass stems ,  and 
that ran away behind the river bank trees .  



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 23 

What do we do ?  asked Macomber .  

Not much choice ,  said Wilson .  We cant bring the car 
over! Banks too steep .  Well let him stiffen up a bit and then 
you and Ill go in and have a look for him .  

Cant we set the grass on lire ?  Macomber asked .  

Too green .  

Cant we send beaters ?  

Wilson looked at him appi^iisingly .  Of course We can /  he 
said .  But its just a touch murderous .  You see we know the 
lions wounded .  You can drive an unwounded lion hell 
move on ahead of a noise but a wounded lions going to 
charge .  You cant see him until youre right on him .  Hell 
make himself perfectly flat in cover you wouldnt think would 
hide a hare .  You cant very well send boys in there to that 
sort of a show .  Somebody bound to get mauled .  

What about the gun - bearers ?  

Oh ,  theyll go with us .  Its their shauri .  You see ,  they 
signed on for it .  They dont look too happy though ,  do they ? * 

I dont want to go in there ,  said Macomber .  It was out 
before he knew hed said it .  

Neither do I ,  said Wilson very cheerily .  Really no 
choice though .  Then ,  as an afterthought ,  he glanced at 
Macomber and saw suddenly how he was trembling and the 
pitiful look on his face .  

You dont have to go in ,  of course ,  he said .  Thats what 
Im hired for ,  you know .  Thats why Im so expensive .  

You mean youd go in by yourself ?  Why not leave hirm 
there ?  

Robert Wilson ,  whose entire occupation had been with the 
lion and the problem he presented ,  and who had not been 
thinking about Macomber except to note that he was rather 
windy ,  suddenly felt as though he had opened the wrong door 
in an hotel and seen something shameful .  

What do you mean ?  

Why not just leave him ?  

You mean pretend to ourselves he hasnt been hit ?  5 



24 HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 

No .  Just drop it .  

It isnt done .  

Why not ?  

 - for one thing ,  hes certain to be suffering .  For another ,  
someone efse might run onto him .  

I see .  

*But you dont have to have anything to do with it .  

Td like to ,  Macomber said .  Im just scared ,  you know .  

Ill go ahead when we go in ,  Wilson said ,  with Kongoni 
tracking .  You keep behind me and a little to one side .  
Chances are well hear him growl .  If we see him well both 
shoot .  Dont worry about any thing .  Ill keep you backed up .  
As a matter of fact ,  you know ,  perhaps youd better not go .  
It might be much better .  Why dont you go over and join 
the Memsahib while I just get it over with ?  

No ,  I want to go .  

*A11 right ,  said Wilson .  But dont go in if you dont want 
to .  This is my shauri now ,  you know .  

I want to go ,  said Macomber .  

They sat under a tree and smoked .  

Want to go back and speak to the Memsahib while were 
waiting ?  Wilson asked .  

No .  

Til just step back and tell her to be patient .  

*Good /  said Macomber .  He sat there ,  sweating under his 
arms ,  his mouth dry ,  his stomach hollow feeling ,  wanting to 
find courage to tell Wilson to go on and finish off the lion 
without him .  He could not know that Wilson was furious be -  
cause he had not noticed the state he was in earlier and sent 
him back to his wife .  While he sat there Wilson came up .  I 
have your big gun ,  he said .  Take it .  Weve given him time ,  
I think .  Come on .  

Macomber took the big gun and Wilson said: 

Keep behind me and about five yards to the right and do 
exactly as I tell you .  3 Then he spoke in Swahili to the two 
:gun - bearers who looked the picture of gloom .  



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 25 

Lets go ,  he said .  

Could I have a drink of water ?  Macomber asked .  Wilson 
spoSe to the older gun - bearer ,  who wore a canteen on his belt 
and the man unbuckled it ,  unscrewed the top and handed it 
to Macomber ,  who took it noticing how heavy it Seemed a<nd 
how hairy and shoddy the felt covering was in his hand .  He 
raised it to drink and looked ahead at the high grass with the 
flat - topped trees behind it .  A breeze was blowing toward 
them and the grass rippled gently in the wind .  He looked at 
the gun - bearer and he could see the gun - bearer was 
suffering too with fear .  

Thirty - five yards into the grass the big lion lay flattened 
out along the ground .  His ears were back and his only move -  
ment was a slight twitching up and down of his long ,  black -  
tufted tail .  He had turned at bay as soon as he had reached 
this cover and he was sick with the wound through his full 
belly ,  and weakening with the wound through his lungs that 
brought a thin foamy red to his mouth each time he 
breathed .  His flanks were wet and hot and flies were on the 
little opening the solid bullets had made in his tawny hide ,  
and his big yellow eyes ,  narrowed with hate ,  looked straight 
ahead ,  only blinking when the pain came as he breathed ,  
and his claws dug in the soft baked earth .  All of him ,  pain ,  
sickness ,  hatred and all of his remaining strength ,  was 
tightening into an absolute concentration for a rush .  He 
could hear the men talking and he waited ,  gathering all of 
himself into this preparation for a charge as soon as the men 
would come into the grass .  As he heard their voices his tail 
stiffened to twitch up and down ,  and ,  as they came into the 
edge of the grass ,  he made a "  coughing grunt and charged .  

Kongoni ,  the old gun - bearer ,  in the lead watching the 
blood spoor ,  Wilson watching the grass for any movement ,  
his big gun ready ,  the second gun - bearer looking ahead and 
listening ,  Macomber close to Wilson ,  his rifle cocked ,  they 
had just moved into the grass when Macomber heard the 
blood - choked cbughing grunt ,  and saw the swishing rush in 



26 HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 

the grass .  The next thing he knew he was running ;  running 
wildly ,  in panic in the open ,  running toward the stream .  

He heard the ca - ra - wong \  of Wilsons big rifle ,  and again 
in %  " second crashing carawongl and turning saw the lion ,  
horrible - looking now ,  with half his head seeming to be gone ,  
crawling toward Wilson in the edge of the tall grass while 
the red - faced man worked the bolt on the short ugly rifle and 
aimed carefully as another blasting carawongl came from the 
muzzle ,  and the crawling ,  heavy ,  yellow bulk of the lion stif -  
fened and the huge ,  mutilated head slid forward and Macom -  
ber ,  standing by himself in the clearing where he had run ,  
holding a loaded rifle ,  while two black men and a white man 
looked back at him in contempt ,  knew the lion was dead .  
He came toward Wilson ,  his tallness all seeming a naked 
reproach ,  and Wilson looked at him and said: 

Want to take pictures ?  

No ,  he said .  

That was all anyone had said until they reached the motor 
car .  Then Wilson had said: 

Hell of a fine lion .  Boys will skin him out .  We might as 
well stay here in the shade .  

Macombers wife had not looked at him nor he at her and 
he had sat by her in the back seat with Wilson sitting in the 
front seat .  Once he had reached over and taken his wifes 
hand without looking at her and she had removed her hand 
from his .  Looking across the stream to where the gun -  
bearers were skinning out the lion he could see that she had 
been able to see the whole thing .  While they sat there his 
wife had reached forward and put her hand on Wilsons 
shoulder .  He turned and she had leaned forward over the 
low seat and kissed him on the mouth .  

Oh ,  I say ,  said Wilson ,  going redder than his natural 
baked colour .  

Mr .  Robert Wilson ,  she said .  The beautifully red - faced 
Mr .  Robert Wilson .  

Then she sat down beside Macomber again and looked 



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 27 

away across the stream to where the lion lay ,  with uplifted ,  
whitfc - muscled ,  tendon - marked naked forearms ,  and white 
bloating belly ,  as the black men fleshed away the skin .  
Finally the gun - bearers brought the skinover ,  wet and heavy ,  
and climbed in behind with it ,  rolling it up before they got 
in ,  and the motor car started .  No one had said anything 
more until they were back in camp .  

That was the story of the lion .  Macomber did not know 
how the lion had felt before he started his rush ,  nor during it 
when the unbelievable smash of the  . 505 with a muzzle 
velocity of two tons had hit him in the mouth ,  nor what kept 
him coming after that ,  when the second ripping crash had 
smashed his hind quarters and he had come crawling on 
toward the crashing ,  blasting thing that had destroyed him .  
Wilson knew something about it and only expressed it by 
saying / Damned fine lion ,  but Macomber did not know how 
Wilson felt about things either .  He did not know how his 
wife felt except that she was through with him .  

His wife had beerr through with him before but it never 
lasted .  He was very wealthy ,  and would be much wealthier ,  
and he knew she would not leave him ever now .  That was 
one of the few things that he really knew .  He knew about 
that ,  about motor cycles that was earliest about motor 
cars ,  about duck - shooting ,  about fishing ,  trout ,  salmon and 
big - sea ,  about sex in books ,  many books ,  too many books ,  
about all court games ,  about dogs ,  not much about horses ,  
about hanging on to his money ,  about most of the other 
things his world dealt in ,  and about his wife not leaving him .  
His wife had been a great beauty and she was still a great 
beauty in Africa ,  but she was not a great enough beauty any 
more at home to be able to leave him and better herself and 
she knew it and he knew it .  She had missed the chance to 
leave him and he knew it .  If he had been better with women 
she would probably have started to worry about him 
getting another new ,  beautiful wife ;  but she knew too 
much about him to worry about him either .  Also ,  he had 



28 HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 

always had a great tolerance which seemed the nicest thing 
about him if it were not the most sinister .  * 

All in all they were known as a comparatively happily*mar -  
riecl couple ,  one of those whose disruption is often rumoured 
but never* occurs ,  and as the society columnist put it ,  they 
were adding more than a spice of adventure to their much 
envied and ever - enduring Romance by a Safari in what was 
known as* Darkest Africa until the Martin Johnsons lighted it 
on so many silver screens where they were pursuing Old 
Simba the lion ,  the buffalo ,  Tembo the elephant and as well 
collecting specimens for the Museum of Natural History .  
This same columnist had reported them on the verge at least 
three times in the past and they had been .  But they always 
made it up .  They had a sound basis of union .  Margot was 
too beautiful for Macomber to divorce her and Macomber 
had too much money for Margot ever to leave him .  

It was now about three oclock in the morning and Francis 
Macomber ,  who had been asleep a little while after he had 
stopped thinking about the lion ,  wakened and then slept 
again ,  woke suddenly ,  frightened in a dream of the bloody -  
headed lion standing over him ,  and listening while his heart 
pounded ,  he realized that his wife was not in the other cot 
in the tent .  He lay awake with that knowledge for two hours .  

At the end of that time his wife came into the tent ,  lifted 
her mosquito bar and crawled cozily into bed .  

Where have you been ?  3 Macomber asked in the darkness .  

Hello ,  she said .  Are you awake ?  

Where have you been ?  

I just went out to get a breath of air .  

You did ,  like hell .  

What do you want me to say ,  darling ?  

Where have you been ?  

Out to get a breath of air .  

Thats a new name for it .  You are a bitch .  

Well ,  youre a coward .  

All right /  he said .  What of it ?  



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 29 

Nothing as far as Im concerned .  But please lets not talk 
darling ,  because Im very sleepy .  

You think that Ill take anything .  

I know you will ,  sweet .  

Well ,  I wont .  

Please ,  darling ,  lets not talk .  Im so very sleepy .  

There wasnt going to be any of that .  You promised there 
wouldnt be .  

Well ,  there is now ,  she said sweetly .  

You said if we made this trip that there would be none 
of that .  You promised .  

Yes ,  darling .  Thats the way I meant it to be .  But the 
trip was spoiled yesterday .  We dont have to talk about it ,  
do we ?  

You dont wait long when you have an advantage ,  
do you ?  

Please lets not talk .  Im so sleepy ,  darling .  

Tm going to talk .  

Dont mind me then ,  because Im going to sleep .  And 
she did .  

At breakfast they were all three at the table before day -  
light and Francis Macomber found that ,  of all the many men 
that he had hated ,  he hated Robert Wilson the most .  

Sleep well ?  Wilson asked in his throaty voice ,  filling a pipe .  

Did you ?  

Topping ,  the white hunter told him .  

You bastard ,  thought Macomber ,  you insolent bastard .  

So she woke him when she came in ,  Wilson thought ,  look -  
ing at them both with his flat ,  cold eyes .  Well ,  why doesnt 
he keep his wife where she belongs ?  What does he think I 
am ,  a bloody plaster saint ?  Let him keep her where she 
belongs .  Its his own fault .  

Do you think well find buffalo ?  Margot asked ,  pushing 
away a dish of apricots .  

Chance of it ,  Wilson said and smiled at her .  Why dont 
you stay in camp ?  



30 HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 

Not for anything ,  she told him .  

Why not order her to stay in camp ?  Wilson said to 
Macomber .  

iYou order her ,  said Macomber coldly .  

Lets not have any ordering ,  nor ,  turning to Macomber ,  
any silliness ,  Francis ,  Margot said quite pleasantly .  

Are you ready to start ?  Macomber asked .  

Any time ,  Wilson told him .  Do you want the Memsahib 
to go ?  

Does it make any difference whether I do or not ?  

The hell with it ,  thought Robert Wilson .  The utter com -  
plete hell with it .  So this is what its going to be like .  Well ,  
this is what its going to be like ,  then .  

Makes no difference ,  he said .  

Youre sure you wouldnt like to stay in camp with her 
yourself and let me go out and hunt the buffalo ?  Macomber 
asked .  

Cant do that ,  said Wilson .  Wouldnt talk rot if I were 
you .  

Tm not talking rot .  Im disgusted .  

Bad word ,  disgusted .  

Francis ,  will you please try to speak sensibly ?  his wife said .  

I speak too damned sensibly ,  Macomber said .  Did you 
ever eat such filthy food ?  

Something wrong with the food ?  asked Wilson quietly .  

No more than with everything else .  

Id pull yourself together ,  laddybuck /  Wilson said very 
quietly .  Theres a boy waits at table that understands a 
little English .  

The hell with him .  

Wilson stood up and puffing on his pipe strolled away ,  
speaking a few words in Swahili to one of the gun - bearers 
who was standing waiting for him .  Macomber and his wife 
sat on at the table .  He was staring at his coffee cup .  

If you make a scene Ill leave you ,  darling ,  Margot said 
quietly .  



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS M A C O M B E R 31 

No ,  you wont .  

You can try it and see .  

You wont leave me .  

No /  she said .  C I wont leave you and youll behave 
yourself .  

Behave myself ?  Thats a way to talk .  Behave myself .  

Yes .  Behave yourself .  

Why dont you try behaving ?  

Ive tried it so long .  So very long .  

I hate that red - faced swine /  Macomber said .  I loathe the 
sight of him .  

Hes really very nice .  

Oh ,  shut up ?  Macomber almost shouted .  Just then the car 
came up and stopped in front of the dining tent and the 
driver and the two gun - bearers got out .  Wilson walked over 
and looked at the husband and wife sitting there at the table .  

Going shooting ?  he asked .  

Yes /  said Macomber ,  standing up .  Yes .  

Better bring a woolly .  It will be cool in the car /  Wilson 
said .  

Til get my leather jacket /  Margot said .  

The boy has it /  Wilson told her .  He climbed into the 
front with the driver and Francis Macomber and his wife 
sat ,  not speaking ,  in the back seat .  

Hope the silly beggar doesnt take a notion to blow the 
back of my head off ,  Wilson thought to himself .  Women are 
a nuisance on safari .  

The car was grinding down to cross the river at a pebbly 
ford in the grey daylight and then climbed ,  angling up the 
steep bank ,  where Wilson had ordered a way shovelled out 
the day before so they could reach the parklike wooded 
rolling country on the far side .  

It was a good morning ,  Wilson thought .  There was a 
heavy dew and as the wheels went through the grass and low 
bushes he could smell the odour of the crushed fronds .  It was 
an odour like verbena and he liked this early morning smell 



32 HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 

of the dew ,  the crushed bracken and the look of the tree 
trunks showing black through the early morning mist ,  as t the 
car made its way through the untracked ,  parklike country .  
HeJhad put the two in the back seat out of his mind now and 
was thinking about buffalo .  The buffalo that he was after 
stayed in the daytime in a thick swamp where it was impos -  
sible to get a shot ,  but in the night they fed out into an open 
stretch of Country and if he could come between them and 
their swamp with the car ,  Macomber would have a good 
chance at them in the open .  He did not want to hunt buff 
with Macomber in thick cover .  He did not want to hunt buff 
or anything else with Macomber at all ,  but he was a pro -  
fessional hunter and he had hunted with some rare ones in his 
time .  If they got buff to - day there would only be rhino to 
come and the poor man would have gone through his dan -  
gerous game and things might pick up .  Hed have nothing 
more to do with the woman and Macomber would get over 
that too .  He must have gone through plenty of that before 
by the look of things .  Poor beggar .  He must have a way of 
getting over it .  Well ,  it was the poor sods own bloody fault .  

He ,  Robert Wilson ,  carried a double size cot on safari to 
accommodate any windfalls he might receive .  He had 
hunted for a certain clientele ,  the international ,  fast ,  sporting 
set ,  where the women did not feel they were getting their 
moneys worth unless they had shared that cot with the 
white hunter .  He despised them when he was away from 
them although he liked some of them well enough at the time ,  
but he made his living by them ;  and their standards were 
his standards as long as they were hiring him .  

They were his standards in all except the shooting .  He had 
his own standards about the killing and they could live up to 
them or get someone else to hunt them .  He knew ,  too ,  that 
they all respected him for this .  This Macomber was art odd 
one though .  Damned if he wasnt .  Now the wife .  Well ,  the 
wife .  Yes ,  the wife ,  Mm ,  the wife .  Well ,  hed dropped all 
that .  He looked around at them .  Macomber sat grim and 



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 33 

furious .  Margot smiled at him .  She looked younger to - day ,  
more innocent and fresher and not so professionally beau -  
tifuh Whats in her heart God knows ,  Wilson thought .  She 
hadnt talked much last night .  At that it was a pleasure to 
see her .  9 

The mottfr car climbed up a slight rise and went on 
through the trees and then out into a grassy prairie - like 
opening and kept in the shelter of the trees along the edge ,  
the driver going slowly and Wilson looking carefully out 
across the prairie and all along its far side .  He stopped the 
car and studied the opening with his field glasses .  Then he 
motioned to the driver to go on and the car moved slowly 
along ,  the driver avoiding wart - hog holes and driving 
around the mud castles ants had built .  Then ,  looking across 
the opening ,  Wilson suddenly turned and said : 

By God ,  there they are! 

And looking where he pointed ,  while the car jumped 
forward and Wilson spoke in rapid Swahili to the driver ,  
Macomber saw three huge ,  black animals looking almost 
cylindrical in their long heaviness ,  like big black tank cars ,  
moving at a gallop across the far edge of the open prairie .  
They moved at a stiff - necked ,  stiff - bodied gallop and he 
could see the upswept wide black horns on their heads as 
they galloped heads out ;  the heads not moving .  

Theyre three old bulls ,  Wilson said .  Well cut them off 
before they get to the swamp .  

 .  The car was going a wild forty - five miles an hour across the 
open ,  and as Macomber watched ,  the buffalo got bigger and 
bigger until he could see the grey ,  hairless ,  scabby look of one 
huge bull and how his neck was a part of his shoulders and 
the shiny black of his horns as he galloped a little behind the 
others that were strung out in that steady plunging gait ;  and 
then ,  the car swaying as though it had just jumped a road ,  
they drew up close and he could see the plunging hugeness of 
the bull ,  and the dust in his sparsely haired hide ,  the wide 
boss of horn and his outstretched ,  wide - nostrilled muzzle ,  



34 HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 

and he was raising his rifle when Wilson shouted ,  Not from 
the car ,  you fool! and he had no fear ,  only hatred of Wilson ,  
while the brakes clamped on and the car skidded ,  ploughing 
sideways to an almost stop and Wilson was out on one side 
and he on the other ,  stumbling as his feet hit the still speeding -  
by of the earth ,  and then he was shooting at the bull as he 
moved away ,  hearing the bullets whunk into him ,  emptying 
his rifle at him as he moved steadily away ,  finally remem -  
bering to get his shots forward into the shoulder ,  and as he 
fumbled to re - load ,  he saw the bull was down .  Down on his 
knees ,  his big head tossing ,  and seeing the other two still 
galloping he shot at the leader and hit him .  He shot again 
and missed and he heard the carawonging roar as Wilson shot 
and saw the leading bull slide forward onto his nose .  
Get that other ,  Wilson said .  Now youre shooting! 
But the other bull was moving steadily at the same gallop 
and he missed ,  throwing a spout of dirt ,  and Wilson missed 
and the dust rose in a cloud and Wilson shouted ,  Gome on .  
Hes too far! and grabbed his arm and they were in the car 
again ,  Macomber and Wilson hanging on the sides and 
rocketing swayingly over the uneven ground ,  drawing up on 
the steady ,  plunging ,  heavy - necked ,  straight - moving gallop 
of the bull .  

They were behind him and Macomber was filling his rifle ,  
dropping shells onto the ground ,  jamming it ,  clearing the 
jam ,  then they were almost up with the bull when Wilson 
yelled Stop! 5 and the car skidded so that it almost swung 
over and Macomber fell forward onto his feet ,  slammed his 
bolt forward and fired as far forward as he could aim into 
the galloping ,  rounded black back ,  aimed and shot again ,  
then again ,  then again ,  and the bullets ,  all of them hitting ,  
had no effect on the buffalo that he could see .  Then Wilson 
shot ,  the roar deafening him ,  and he could see the bull 
stagger .  Macomber shot again ,  aiming carefully ,  and down 
he came ,  onto his knees .  

All right ,  5 Wilson said .  Nice work .  Thats the three .  



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 35 

Macomber felt a drunken elation .  

How many times did you shoot ?  he asked .  

Jhst three /  Wilson said .  You killed the first bull .  The 
biggest one .  I helped you finish the other two .  Afraid fhey 
might have got into cover .  You had them killed .  * I was just 
mopping upa little .  You shot damn well .  

Lets go to the car ,  said Macomber .  I want a drink .  

Got to finish off that buff first ,  Wilson told him .  The 
buffalo was on his knees and he jerked his head furiously and 
bellowed in pig - eyed ,  roaring rage as they came toward him ,  

Watch he doesnt get up ,  Wilson said .  Then ,  Get a little 
broadside and take him in the neck just behind the ear .  

Macomber aimed carefully at the centre of the huge ,  
jerking ,  rage - driven neck and shot .  At the shot the head 
dropped forward .  

That does it ,  said Wilson .  Got the spine .  Theyre a hell 
of a looking thing ,  arent they ?  

Lets get the drink ,  said Macomber .  In his life he had 
never felt so good .  

In the car Macombers wife sat very white faced .  You 
were marvellous ,  darling ,  she said to Macomber .  What a^ 
ride .  

Was it rough ?  Wilson asked .  

It was frightful .  Ive never been more frightened in my 
life .  

Lets all have a drink ,  Macomber said .  

By all means ,  said Wilson .  Give it to the Memsahib .  She 
drank the neat whisky from the flask and shuddered a little 
when she swallowed .  She handed the flask to Macomber who 
handed it to Wilson .  

It was frightfully exciting ,  she said .  Its given me a 
dreadful headache .  I didnt know you were allowed to 
shoot them from cars though .  3 

No one shot from cars ,  said Wilson coldly .  

I mean chase them from cars .  

Wouldnt ordinarily /  Wilson said .  Seemed sporting 



36 HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 

enough to me though while we were doing it .  Taking more 
chance driving that way across the plain full of holes and one 
thing and another than hunting on foot .  Buffalo could have 
charged us each time we shot if he liked .  Gave him every 
chance .  Wouldnt mention it to anyone though .  Its illegal 
if thats what you mean .  5 

It seemed very unfair to me ,  Margot said ,  chasing those 
big helpless things in a motor car .  

Did it ?  said Wilson .  

What would happen if they heard about it in Nairobi ?  

Id lose my licence for one thing .  Other unpleasant -  
nesses ,  Wilson said ,  taking a drink from the flask .  Td be 
out of business .  

Really ?  

Yes ,  really .  

Well ,  said Macomber ,  and he smiled for the first time all 
day .  Now she has something on you .  

You have such a pretty way of putting things ,  Francis ,  
Margot Macomber said .  Wilson looked at them both .  If a 
four - letter man marries a five - letter woman ,  he was thinking ,  
what number of letters would their children be ?  What he 
said was We lost a gun - bearer .  Did you notice it ?  

My God ,  no /  Macomber said .  

Here he comes ,  Wilson said .  Hes all right .  He must 
have fallen off when we left the first bull .  

Approaching them was the middle - aged gun - bearer ,  limp -  
ing along in his knitted cap ,  khaki tunic ,  shorts and rubber 
sandals ,  gloomy - faced and disgusted looking .  As he came up 
he called out to Wilson in Swahili and they all saw the 
change in the white hunters face .  

What does he say ?  asked Margot .  

He says the first bull got up and went into the bush ,  
Wilson said with no expression in his voice .  

Oh /  said Macomber blankly .  

Then its going to be just like the lion ,  3 said Margot ,  full 
of anticipation .  



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 37 

Its not going to be a damned bitlike the lion ,  Wilson told 
her ,  ,  Did you want another drink ,  Macomber ?  

Thanks ,  yes ,  Macomber said .  He expected the feeling he 
had had about the lion to come back but it did not .  Forthe 
first time in his life he really felt wholly without feajr .  Instead 
of fear he had a feeling of definite elation .  

Well go and have a look at the second bull ,  Wilson said .  
Til tell the driver to put the car in the shade .  

What are you going to do ?  asked Margot Macomber .  

Take a look at the buff ,  Wilson said .  

Til come .  

Come along .  

The three of them walked over to where the second buffalo 
bulked blackly in the open ,  head forward on the grass ,  the 
massive horns swung wide .  

Hes a very good head ,  Wilson said .  Thats close to a 
fifty - inch spread .  

Macomber was looking at him with delight .  

Hes hateful looking ,  said Margot .  Cant we go into the 
shade ?  

Of course ,  Wilson said .  Look ,  he said to Macomber ,  and 
pointed .  See that patch of bush ?  

Yes .  

Thats where the first bull went in .  The gun - bearer said 
when he fell off the bull was down .  He was watching us 
helling along and the other two buff galloping .  When he 
looked up there was the bull up and looking at him .  Gun -  
bearer ran like hell and the bull went off slowly into that 
bush .  

Can we go in after him now ?  asked Macomber eagerly .  

Wilson looked at him appraisingly .  Damned if this isnt a 
strange one ,  he thought .  Yesterday hes scared sick and 
to - day hes a ruddy fire - eater .  

No ,  well give him a while .  

Lets please go into the shade ,  Margot said .  Her face was 
white and s}ie looked ill .  



38 HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 

They made their way to the car where it stood under a 
single wide - spreading tree and all climbed in .   ,  

Chances are hes dead in there ,  5 Wilson remarked .  After 
a little well have a look .  5 

Macon \ ber felt a wild unreasonable happiness that he had 
never known before .  

By God ,  that was a chase /  he said .  Ive never felt any 
such feelirg .  Wasnt it marvellous ,  Margot ?  

I hated it .  3 

Why ?  

I hated it ,  she said bitterly .  I loathed it .  

You know ,  I dont think Id ever be afraid of anything 
again ,  5 Macomber said to Wilson .  Something happened in 
me after we first saw the buff and started after him .  Like a 
dam bursting .  It was pure excitement .  

Cleans out your liver ,  said Wilson .  Damn funny things 
happen to people .  

Macombers face was shining .  You know ,  something did 
happen to me ,  he said .  I feel absolutely different .  

His wife said nothing and eyed him strangely .  She was 
sitting far back in the seat and Macomber was sitting forward 
talking to Wilson who turned sideways talking over the back 
of the front seat .  

You know ,  Id like to try another lion ,  5 Macomber said .  
Im really not afraid of them now .  After all ,  what can they 
do to you ?  

Thats it ,  said Wilson .  Worst one can do is kill you .  How 
does it go ?  Shakespeare .  Damned good .  See if I can remem -  
ber .  Oh ,  damned good .  Used to quote it to myself at one 
time .  Lets see .   " By my troth ,  I cafe not ;  a man can die but 
once ;  we owe God a death ,  and let it go which way it will he 
that dies this year is quit for the next .  "  Damned fine ,  eh ?  

He was very embarrassed ,  having brought out this thing he 
had lived by ,  but he had seen men come of age before and it 
always moved him .  It was not a matter of their twenty - first 
birthday .  



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS M A C O M B E R 39 

It had taken a strange chance of hunting ,  a sudden precipi -  
tation into action without opportunity for worrying before -  
hand ,  to bring this about with Macomber ,  but regardless of 
how it had happened it had most certainly happened .  Look at 
the beggar now ,  Wilson thought .  Its that some of them stay 
little boys soiong ,  Wilson thought .  Sometimes all their lives .  
Their figures stay boyish when theyre fifty .  The great 
American boy - men .  Damned strange people .  Bijt he liked 
this Macomber now .  Damned strange fellow .  Probably 
meant the end of cuckoldry too .  Well ,  that would be a 
damned good thing .  Damned good thing .  Beggar had 
probably been afraid all his life .  Dont know what started it .  
But over now .  Hadnt had time to be afraid with the buff .  
That and being angry too .  Motor car too .  Motor cars made 
it familiar .  Be a damn fire - eater now .  Hed seen it in the war 
work the same way .  More of a change than any loss of 
virginity .  Fear gone like an operation .  Something else 
grew in its place .  Main thing a man had .  Made him into 
a man .  Women knew it too .  No bloody fear .  

From the far corner of the seat Margaret Macomber 
looked at the two of them .  There was no change in Wilson .  
She saw Wilson as she had seen him the day before when she 
had first realized what his great talent was .  But she saw the 
change in Francis Macomber now .  

Do you have that feeling of happiness about whats going 
to happen ?  Macomber asked ,  still exploring his new wealth .  

Youre not supposed to mention it ,  Wilson said ,  looking 
in the others face .  Much more fashionable to say youre 
scared .  Mind you ,  youll be scared too ,  plenty of times .  

But you have a feeling of happiness about action to come ?  

Yes ,  said Wilson .  Theres that .  Doesnt do to talk too 
much about all this .  Talk the whole thing away .  No 
pleasure in anything if you mouth it up too much .  

Youre both talking rot ,  said Margot .  Just because 
youve chased some helpless animals in a motor car you talk 
like heroes .  



40 HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 

Sorry /  said Wilson .  I have been gassing too much .  Shes 
worried about it already ,  he thought .  

If you dont know what were talking about ,  why not keep 
out of it ?  Macomber asked his wife .  

Youve 4 gotten awfully brave ,  awfully suddenly ,  his wife 
said contemptuously ,  but her contempt was not secure .  She 
was very afraid of something .  

Macomber laughed ,  a very natural hearty laugh .  You 
know I have ,  he said .  C I really have .  

Isnt it sort of late ?  Margot said bitterly .  Because she had 
done the best she could for many years back and the way 
they were together now was no one persons fault .  

Not for me ,  said Macomber .  

Margot said nothing but sat back in the corner of the 
seat .  

Do you think weve given him time enough ?  Macomber 
asked Wilson cheerfully .  

We might have a look ,  Wilson said .  Have you any solids 
left ?  

The gun - bearer has some .  

Wilson called in Swahili and the older gun - bearer ,  who 
was skinning out one of the heads ,  straightened up ,  pulled a 
box of solids out of his pocket and brought them over to 
Macomber ,  who filled his magazine and put the remaining 
shells in his pocket .  

You might as well shoot the Springfield ,  Wilson said .  
Youre used to it .  Well leave the Mannlicher in the car with 
the Memsahib .  Your gun - bearer can carry your heavy gun .  
Ive this damned cannon .  Now let me tell you about them .  
He had saved this until the last because he did not want to 
worry Macomber .  When a buff comes he comes with his 
head high and thrust straight out .  The boss of the horns 
covers any sort of brain shot .  The only shot is straight into 
the nose .  The only other shot is into his chest or ,  if youre to 
one side ,  into the neck or the shoulders .  After theyve been 
hit once they take a hell of a lot of killing .  Dont try any -  



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 41 

thing fancy .  Take the easiest shot there is .  Theyve finished 
skinning out that head now .  Should we get started ?  3 

Hu called to the gun - bearers ,  who came up wiping their 
hands ,  and the older one got into the back .  

Til only take Kongoni ,  5 Wilson said .  The other can watch 
to keep the birds away .  

As the car moved slowly across the open space toward the 
island of brushy trees that ran in a tongue of foliage along a 
dry watercourse that cut the open swale ,  Macomber felt his 
heart pounding and his mouth was dry again ,  but it was 
excitement ,  not fear .  

Heres where he went in /  Wilson said .  Then to the gun -  
bearer in Swahili ,  Take the blood spoor .  

The car was parallel to the patch of bush .  Macomber ,  
Wilson and the gun - bearer got down .  Macomber ,  looking 
back ,  saw his wife ,  with the rifle by her side ,  looking at him .  
He waved to her and she did not wave back .  

The brush was very thick ahead and the ground was dry .  
The middle - aged gun - bearer was sweating heavily and 
Wilson had his hat down over his eyes and his red neck 
showed just ahead of Macomber .  Suddenly the gun - bearer 
said something in Swahili to Wilson and ran forward .  

Hes dead in there ,  Wilson said .  Good work ,  and he 
turned to grip Macombers hand and as they shook hands ,  
grinning at each other ,  the gun - bearer shouted wildly and 
they saw him coming out of the bush sideways ,  fast as a crab ,  
and the bull coming ,  nose out ,  mouth tight closed ,  blood 
dripping ,  massive head straight out ,  coming in a charge ,  his 
little pig eyes bloodshot as he looked at them .  Wilson ,  who 
was ahead ,  was kneeling shooting ,  and Macomber ,  as he fired ,  
unhearing his shot in the roaring of Wilsons gun ,  saw frag -  
ments like slate burst from the huge boss of the horns ,  and the 
head jerked ;  he shot again at the wide nostrils and saw the 
horns jolt again and fragments fly ,  and he did not see Wilson 
now and ,  aiming carefully ,  shot again with the buffalos huge 
bulk almost on him and his rifle almost level with the on -  



42 HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 

coming head ,  nose out ,  and he could see the little wicked 
eyes and the head started to lower ,  and he felt a sudden white -  
hot ,  blinding flash explode inside his head and that was all 
he ever felt .  

Wilson Jiad ducked to one side to get in a shoulder shot .  
Macomber had stood solid and shot for the nose ,  shooting a 
touch high each time and hitting the heavy horns ,  splintering 
and chippmg them like hitting a slate roof ,  and Mrs .  Macom -  
ber in the car ,  had shot at the buffalo with the 6 . 5 Mann -  
licher as it seemed about to gore Macomber and had hit her 
husband about two inches up and a little to one side of the 
base of his skull .  

Francis Macomber lay now ,  face down ,  not two yards from 
where the buffalo lay on his side and his wife knelt over him 
with Wilson beside her .  

I wouldnt turn him over ,  Wilson said .  
The woman was crying hysterically .  
Td get back in the car ,  Wilson said .  Wheres the rifle ?  
She shook her head ,  her face contorted .  The gun - bearer 
picked up the rifle ,  

Leave it as it is ,  said Wilson .  Then ,  Go get Abdulla so 
that he may witness the manner of the accident .  

He knelt down ,  took a handkerchief from his pocket ,  and 
spread it over Francis Macombers crew - cropped head where 
it lay .  The blood sank into the dry ,  loose earth .  

Wilson stood up and saw the buffalo on his side ,  his legs 
out ,  his thinly - haired belly crawling with ticks .  Hell of a 
good bull ,  his brain registered automatically .  C A good fifty 
inches ,  or better .  Better .  He called to the driver and told 
him to spread a blanket over the body and stay by it .  Then 
he walked over to the motor car where the woman sat crying 
in the corner .  

That was a pretty thing to do ,  he said in a toneless voice .  
He would have left you too .  
Stop it ,  she said .  
Of course its an accident ,  he said .  I know that .  



HAPPY LIFE OF FRANCIS MACOMBER 43 

Stop it ,  she said .  

Dont worry ,  he said .  There will be a certain amount of 
unpleasantness but I will have some photographs taken that 
will be very useful at the inquest .  Theres the testimony of the 
gun - bearers and the driver too .  Youre perfectly all right .  

Stop it ,  she said .  

Theres a hell of a lot to be done ,  he said .  And Ill have 
to send a truck off to the lake to wireless for a plane to take 
the three of us into Nairobi .  Why didnt you poison him ?  
Thats what they do in England .  

Stop it .  Stop it .  Stop it ,  the woman cried .  

Wilson looked at her with his flat blue eyes .  

Im through now ,  he said .  I was a little angry .  Id begun 
to like your husband .  

Oh ,  please stop it ,  she said .  Please ,  please stop it .  

Thats better ,  Wilson said .  Please is much better .  Now 
Ill stop .  



THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD 

MADRID is full of boys named Paco ,  which is the diminfttive 
of the name Francisco ,  and there is a Madrid joke about a 
father who came to Madrid and inserted an advertisement in 
the personal columns of El Liberal which said: PAGO MEET ME 
AT HOTEL MONTANA NOON TUESDAY ALL is FORGIVEN PAPA ,  
and how g ,  squadron of Guardia Civil had to be called out to 
disperse the eight hundred young men who answered the 
advertisement .  But this Paco ,  who waited on table at the 
Pension Luarca ,  had no father to forgive him ,  nor anything 
for the father to forgive .  He had two older sisters who were 
chambermaids at the Luarca ,  who had gotten their place 
through coming from the same small village as a former 
Luarca chambermaid who had proven hardworking and 
honest and hence given her village and its products a good 
name ;  and these sisters had paid his way on the auto - bus to 
Madrid and gotten him his job as an apprentice waiter .  He 
came from a village in a part of Extremadura where con -  
ditions were incredibly primitive ,  food scarce ,  and comforts 
unknown ,  and he had worked hard ever since he could 
remember .  

He was a well built boy with very black ,  rather curly hair ,  
good teeth and a skin that his sisters envied ,  and he had a 
ready and unpuzzled smile .  He was fast on his feet and did 
his work well and he loved his sisters ,  who seemed beautiful 
and sophisticated ;  he loved Madrid ,  which was still an un -  
believable place ,  and he loved his work which ,  done under 
bright lights ,  with clean linen ,  the wearing of evening clothes ,  
and abundant food in the kitchen ,  seemed romantically 
beautiful .  

There were from eight to a dozen other people who lived at 
the Luarca and ate in the dining - room ,  but for Paco ,  the 
youngest of the three waiters who served at table ,  the only 
ones who really existed were the bull fighters .  

Second - rate matadors lived at that pension because the 

44 



THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD 45 

address in the Calle San Jeronimo was good ,  the food was 
excellent and the room and board was cheap .  It is necessary 
for a bull fighter to give the appearance ,  if not of prosperity ,  
at least of respectability ,  since decorum and dignity rank 
above courage as the virtues most highly prized in Spain ,  and 
bull fighters  " stayed at the Luarca until their last pesetas were 
gone .  There is no record of any bull fighter having left the 
Luarca for a better or more expensive hotel ;  second - rate bull 
fighters never became first rate ;  but the descent from the 
Luarca was swift since anyone could stay there who was 
making anything at all and a bill was never presented to a 
guest unasked until the woman who ran the place knew that 
the case was hopeless .  

At this time there were three full matadors living at the 
Luarca as well as two very good picadors ,  and one excellent 
banderillero .  The Luarca was luxury for the picadors and 
the banderilleros who ,  with their families in Seville ,  required 
lodging in Madrid during the Spring season ;  but they were 
well paid and in the fixed employ of fighters who were 
heavily contracted during the coming season and the three 
of these subalterns would probably make much more apiece 
than any of the three matadors .  Of the three matadors one 
was ill and trying to conceal it ;  one had passed his short 
vogue as a novelty ;  and the third was a coward .  

The coward had at one time ,  until he had received a 
peculiar atrocious horn wound in the lower abdomen at the 
start of his first season as a full matador ,  been exceptionally 
brave and remarkably skilful and he still had many of the 
hearty mannerisms of his days of success .  He was jovial to 
excess and laughed constantly with and without provocation .  
He had ,  when successful ,  been very addicted to practical 
jokes ,  but he had given them up now .  They took an assur -  
ance that he did not feel .  This matador had an intelligent ,  
very open face and he carried himself with much style .  

The matador who was ill was careful never to show it and 
was meticulous about eating a little of all the dishes that were 



46 THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD 

presented at the table .  He had a great many handkerchiefs 
which he laundered himself in his room and ,  lately ,  he had 
been selling his fighting suits .  He had sold one ,  chdaply ,  
before Christmas and another in the first week of April .  
They had been very expensive suits ,  had always been well 
kept and he had one more .  Before he had became ill he had 
been a very promising ,  even a sensational ,  fighter and ,  while 
he himself could not read ,  he had clippings which said that 
in his debut in Madrid he had been better than Belmonte .  
He ate alone at a small table and looked up very little .  

The matador who had once been a novelty was very short 
and brown and very dignified .  He also ate alone at a separate 
table and he smiled very rarely and never laughed .  He came 
from Valladolid ,  where the people are extremely serious ,  and 
he was a capable matador ;  but his style had become old -  
fashioned before he had ever succeeded in endearing himself 
to the public through his virtues ,  which were courage and a 
calm capability ,  and his name on a poster would draw no 
one to a bull ring .  His novelty had been that he was so 
short that he could barely see over the bulls withers ,  but 
there were other short fighters ,  and he had never succeeded 
in imposing himself on the publics fancy .  

Of the picadors one was a thin ,  hawk - faced ,  grey - haired 
man ,  lightly built but with legs and arms like iron ,  who 
always wore cattlemens boots under his trousers ,  drank too 
much every evening and gazed amorously at any woman in 
the pension .  The other was huge ,  dark ,  brown - faced ,  good -  
looking ,  with black hair like an Indian and enormous hands .  
Both were great picadors although the first was reputed to 
have lost much of his ability ^through drink and dissipation ,  
and the second was said to be too headstrong and quarrel -  
some to stay with any matador more than a single season .  

The banderillero was middle - aged ,  grey ,  cat - quick in spite 
of his years and ,  sitting at the table he looked a moderately 
prosperous business man .  His legs were still good for this 
season ,  and when they should go he was intelligent and 



THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD 47 

experienced enough to keep regularly employed for a long 
time .  The difference would be that when his speed of foot 
wouM be gone he would always be frightened where now 
he was assured and calm in the ring and out of it .   ,  

On this evening every one had left the dining - room except 
the hawk - faeed picador who drank too much ,  the birth -  
marked - faced auctioneer of watches at the fairs and festivals 
of Spain ,  who also drank too much ,  and two priests from 
Galicia who were sitting at a corner table and drinking if 
not too much certainly enough .  At that time wine was 
included in the price of the room and board at the Luarca ,  
and the waiters had just brought fresh bottles of Valdcpefias 
to the tables of the auctioneer ,  then to the picador and ,  
finally ,  to the two priests .  

The three waiters stood at the end of the room .  It was the 
rule of the house that they should all remain on duty until the 
diners whose tables they were responsible for should all have 
left ,  but the one who served the table of the two priests had an 
appointment to go to an Anarcho - Syndicalist meeting and 
Paco had agreed to take over his table for him .  

Upstairs the matador who was ill was lying face down on 
his bed alone .  The matador who was no longer a novelty 
was sitting looking out of his window preparatory to walking 
out to the cafe .  The matador who was a coward had the 
older sister of Paco in his room with him and was trying to 
get her to do something which she was laughingly refusing 
to do .  This matador was saying Gome on ,  little savage .  

No ,  said the sister .  Why should I ?  

Tor a favour .  

Youve eaten and now you want me for dessert .  

Just once .  What harm can it do ?  

Leave me alone .  Leave me alone ,  I tell you .  

It is a very little thing to do .  

Leave me alone ,  I tell you .  

Down in the dining - room the tallest of the waiters ,  who was 
overdue at the meeting ,  said ,  Look at those black pigs drink .  



48 THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD 

Thats no way to speak /  said the second waiter .  They 
are decent clients .  They do not drink too much .  

Tor me it is a good way to speak ,  said the tall one .  There 
arc the two curses of Spain ,  the bulls and the priests .  

Certainly not the individual bull and the individual 
priest ,  said the second waiter .  * 

Yes ,  said the tall waiter .  Only through the individual 
can you attack the class .  It is necessary to kill the individual 
bull and the individual priest .  All of them .  Then there are 
no more .  

Save it for the meeting ,  said the other waiter .  

Look at the barbarity of Madrid ,  said the tall waiter .  It 
is now half - past eleven oclock and these are still guzzling .  3 

They only started to eat at ten ,  said the other waiter .  As 
you know there are many dishes .  That wine is cheap and 
these have paid for it .  It is not a strong wine .  

How can there be solidarity of workers with fools like you ?  
asked the tall waiter .  

Look ,  said the second waiter who was a man of fifty .  I 
have worked all my life .  In all that remains of my life I must 
work .  I have no complaints against work .  To work is normal .  

Yes ,  but the lack of work kills .  

I have always worked ,  said the older waiter .  Go on to 
the meeting .  There is no necessity to stay .  

You are a good comrade ,  said the tall waiter .  But you 
lack all ideology .  

Mejor si me falta eso que el otroj said the older waiter 
 ( meaning it is better to lack that than work )  .  Go on to the 
mitin .  

Paco had said nothing .  He did not yet understand politics 
but it always gave him a thrill to hear the tall waiter speak of 
the necessity for killing the priests and the Guardia Civil .  
The tall waiter represented to him revolution and revolution 
also was romantic .  He himself would like to be a good 
catholic ,  a revolutionary ,  and have a steady job like this ,  
while ,  at the same time ,  being a bull fighter .  



THE CAPITAL OF T FIE WORLD 49 

Go on to the meeting ,  Ignacio /  he said .  I will respond for 
younwork .  

Tne two of us /  said the older waiter .  

There isnt enough for one /  said Paco .  Go on to tfie 
meeting .  

Pues ,  me voy ,  said the tall waiter .  And thanks .  

In the meantime ,  upstairs ,  the sister of Paco had gotten out 
of the embrace of the matador as skilfully as a wrestler 
breaking a hold and said ,  now angry ,  These are the hungry 
people .  A failed bull fighter .  With your ton - load of fear .  If 
you have so much of that ,  use it in the ring .  

That is the way a whore talks .  

A whore is also a woman ,  but I am not a whore .  

Youll be one .  

Not through you .  

Leave me ,  said the matador who ,  now ,  repulsed and 
refused ,  felt the nakedness of his cowardice returning .  

Leave you ?  What hasnt left you ?  said the sister .  Dont 
you want me to make up the bed ?  Im paid to do that .  

Leave me ,  said the matador ,  his broad good - looking face 
wrinkled into a contortion that was like crying .  You whore .  
You dirty little whore .  

Matador ,  she said ,  shutting the door .  My matador .  

Inside the room the matador sat on the bed .  His face still 
had the contortion which ,  in the ring ,  he made into a 
constant smile which frightened those people in the first 
rows of seats who knew what they were watching .  And this /  
he was saying aloud .  And this .  And this .  

He could remember when he had been good and it had 
only been three years before .  He could remember the weight 
of the heavy gold - brocaded fighting jacket on his shoulders 
on that hot afternoon in May when his voice had still been 
the same in the ring as in the cafe ,  and how he sighted along 
the point - dipping blade at the place in the top of the 
shoulders where it was dusty in the short - haired black hump 
of muscle above the wide ,  wood - knocking ,  splintered - tipped 



50 THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD 

horns that lowered as he went in to kill ,  and how the sword 
pushed in as easy as into a mound of stiff butter with the palm 
of his hand pushing the pommel ,  his left arm crossed low ,  his 
left shoulder forward ,  his weight on his left leg ,  and then his 
weight wasnt on his leg .  His weight was on his lower belly 
and as the bull raised his head the horn wa$ out of sight 
in him and he swung over on it twice before they pulled 
him off it .  So now when he went in to kill ,  and it was 
seldom ,  he could not look at the horns and what did 
any whore know about what he went through before he 
fought ?  And what had they been through that laughed 
at him ?  They were all whores and they knew what they 
could do with it .  

Down in the dining - room the picador sat looking at the 
priests .  If there were women in the room he stared at them .  
If there were no women he would stare with enjoyment at a 
foreigner ,  un ingles ,  but lacking women or strangers ,  he now 
stared with enjoyment and insolence at the two priests .  
While he stared the birth - marked auctioneer rose and folding 
his napkin went out ,  leaving over half the wine in the last 
bottle he had ordered .  If his accounts had been paid up at 
the Luarca he would have finished the bottle .  

The two priests did not stare back at the picador .  One of 
them was saying / It is ten days since I have been here waiting 
to see him and all day I sit in the ante - chamber and he will 
not receive me .  

What is there to do ?  

Nothing .  What can one do ?  One cannot go against 
authority .  5 

I have been here for two weeks and nothing .  I wait and 
they will not see me .  

We are from the abandoned country .  When the money 
runs out we can return .  

To the abandoned country .  What does Madrid care 
about Galicia ?  We are a poor province .  

 ;  One understands the action of our brother Basilio .  



THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD 51 

* Still I have no real confidence in the integrity of Basilio 
Alvarez .  

Madrid is where one learns to understand .  Madrid kills 
Spain .  

If they would simply see one and refuse .  

No .  You ftiust be broken and worn out by waiting .  

Well ,  we shall see .  I can wait as well as another .  

At this moment the picador got to his feet ,  walked over to 
the priests table and stood ,  grey - headed and hawk - faced ,  
staring at them and smiling .  

A torero ,  said one priest to the other .  

And a good one ,  said the picador and walked out of the 
dining - room ,  grey - jacketed ,  trim - waistcd ,  bow - legged ,  in 
tight breeches over his high - heeled cattlemans boots that 
clicked on the floor as he swaggered quite steadily ,  smiling to 
himself .  He lived in a small ,  tight ,  professional world of 
personal efficiency ,  nightly alcoholic triumph ,  and insolence .  
Now he lit a cigar and tilting his hat at an angle in the 
hallway went out to the cafe .  

The priests left immediately after the picador ,  hurriedly 
conscious of being the last people in the dining - room ,  and 
there was no one in the room now but Paco and the middle -  
aged waiter .  They cleared the tables and carried the 
bottles into the kitchen .  

In the kitchen was the boy who washed the dishes .  He was 
three years older than Paco and was very cynical and bitter .  

Take this ,  the middle - aged waiter said ,  and poured out 
a glass of the Valdepefias and handed it to him .  

Why not ?  the boy took the glass .  

Tu ,  Paco ?  the older waiter asked .  

Thank you ,  said Paco .  The three of them drank .  

I will be going ,  said the middle - aged waiter .  

Good night ,  they told him .  

He went out and they were alone .  Paco took a napkin one 
of the priests had used and standing straight ,  his heels 
planted ,  lowered the napkin and with head following the 



52 THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD 

movement ,  swung his arms in the motion of a slow sweeping 
veronica .  He turned and advancing his right foot slightly ,  
made the second pass ,  gained a little terrain on the imaginary 
bull and made a third pass ,  slow ,  perfectly timed and suave ,  
then gathered the napkin to his waist and swung his hips 
away from the bull in a media - veronica .  

The dishwasher ,  whose name was Enrique ,  watched him 
critically and snecringly .  

How is the bull ?  he said .  

Very brave /  said Paco .  Look .  

Standing slim and straight he made four more perfect 
passes ,  smooth ,  elegant and graceful .  

And the bull ?  asked Enrique standing against the sink ,  
holding his wine glass and wearing his apron .  

Still has lots of gas ,  said Paco .  

You make me sick ,  5 said Enrique .  

Why ?  

Look .  

Enrique removed his apron and citing the imaginary bull 
he sculptured four perfect ,  languid gypsy veronicas and 
ended up with a rebolera that made the apron swing in a 
stiff arc past the bulls nose as he walked away from him .  

Look at that /  he said .  And I wash dishes .  

Why ?  

Fear ,  said Enrique .  Miedo .  The same fear you would 
have in a ring with a bull .  

No ,  said Paco .  I wouldnt be afraid .  

LecheT said Enrique .  Everyone is afraid .  But a torero 
can control his fear so that he can work the bull .  I went in 
an amateur fight and I was so afraid I couldnt keep from 
running .  Every one thought it was very funny .  So would 
you be afraid .  If it wasnt for fear every bootblack in Spain 
would be a bull fighter .  You ,  a country boy ,  would be 
frightened worse than I was .  

No ,  5 said Paco .  

He had done it too many times in his imagination .  Too 



THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD 53 

many times he had seen the horns ,  seen the bulls wet muzzle ,  
the ear twitching ,  then the head go down and the charge ,  the 
hoofs  \ hudding and the hot bull pass him as he swung the 
cape ,  to re - charge as he swung the cape again ,  then agaiy ,  
and again ,  and again ,  to end winding the bull around him 
in his great media -  veronica ,  and walk swingingly away ,  with 
bull hairs caught in the gold ornaments of his jacket from 
the close passes ;  the bull standing hypnotized and tlje crowd 
applauding .  No ,  he would not be afraid .  Others ,  yes .  Not 
he .  He knew he would not be afraid .  Even if he ever was 
afraid he knew that he could do it anyway .  He had con -  
fidence .  I wouldnt be afraid ,  he said .  
Enrique said ,  Leche* again .  
Then he said ,  If we should try it ?  
How ?  

Look ,  said Enrique .  You think of the bull but you do 
not think of the horns .  The bull has such force that the 
horns rip like a knife ,  they stab like a bayonet ,  and they kill 
like a club .  Look ,  he opened a table drawer and took out 
two meat knives .  I will bind these to the legs of a chair .  
Then I will play bull for you with the chair held before my 
head .  The knives are the horns .  If you make those passes 
then they mean something .  

Lend me your apron ,  said Paco .  Well do it in the 
dining - room .  

No ,  said Enrique ,  suddenly not bitter .  Dont do it ,  
Paco .  

Yes ,  said Paco .  Im not afraid .  
You will be when you see the knives come .  
Well see ,  3 said Paco .  Give me the apron .  
At this time ,  while Enrique was binding the two heavy -  
bladed razor - sharp meat knives fast to the legs of the chair 
with two soiled napkins holding the half of each knife ,  wrap -  
ping them tight and then knotting them ,  the two chamber -  
maids ,  Pacos sisters ,  were on their way to the cinema to see 
Greta Garbo in c Anna Christie .  Of the two priests ,  one was 



54 THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD 

sitting in his underwear reading his breviary and the other 
was wearing a nightshirt and saying the rosary .  All the 
bull fighters except the one who was ill had made -  their 
eyening appearance at the Cafe Fornos ,  where the big ,  
dark - haired picador was playing billiards ,  the short ,  serious 
matador was sitting at a crowded table before a coffee and 
milk ,  along with the middle - aged banderillero and other 
serious workmen .  

The drinking ,  grey - headed picador was sitting with a glass 
of cazalas brandy before him staring with pleasure at a 
table where the matador whose courage was gone sat with 
another matador who had renounced the sword to become a 
banderillero again ,  and two very houseworn - looking 
prostitutes .  

The auctioneer stood on the street corner talking with 
friends .  The tall waiter was at the Anarcho - Syndicalist 
meeting waiting for an opportunity to speak .  The middle -  
aged waiter was seated on the terrace of the Cafe Alvarez 
drinking a small beer .  The woman who owned the Luarca 
was already asleep in her bed ,  where she lay on her back 
with the bolster between her legs ;  big ,  fat ,  honest ,  clean ,  
easy - going ,  very religious and never having ceased to miss or 
pray daily for her husband ,  dead ,  now ,  twenty years .  In 
his room ,  alone ,  the matador who was ill lay face down on 
his bed with his mouth against a handkerchief .  

Now ,  in the deserted dining - room ,  Enrique tied the last 
knot in the napkins that bound the knives to the chair legs 
and lifted the chair .  He pointed the legs with the knives on 
them forward and held the chair over his head with the 
two knives pointing straight ahead ,  one on each side of his 
head .  

Its heavy ,  5 he said .  Look ,  Paco .  It is very dangerous .  
Dont do it .  He was sweating .  

Paco stood facing him ,  holding the apron spread ,  holding 
a fold of it bunched in each hand ,  thumbs up ,  first finger 
down ,  spread to catch the eye of the bull .  



THE LD 55 

Charge straight /  he said .  Turn like a Dull .  Charge as 
many times as you want /  

H \  ) w will you know when to cut the pass ?  asked Enrique .  
Its better to do three and then a media .  

All right /  said Paco .  But come straight .  Huh ,  torito! 
Come on ,  littje bull! 

Running with head down Enrique came toward him and 
Paco swung the apron just ahead of the knife blade as it passed 
close in front of his belly and as it went by it was ,  to him ,  the 
real horn ,  white - tipped ,  black ,  smooth ,  and as Enrique 
passed him and turned to rush again it was the hot ,  blood -  
flanked mass of the bull that thudded by ,  then turned like 
a cat and came again as he swung the cape slowly .  Then the 
bull turned and came again and ,  as he watched the onrushing 
point ,  he stepped his left foot two inches too far forward 
and the knife did not pass ,  but had slipped in as easily as 
into a wineskin and there was a hot scalding rush above and 
around the sudden inner rigidity of steel and Enrique 
shouting .  Ay! Ay! Let me get it out! Let me get it out! 
and Paco slipped forward on the chair the apron cape still 
held ,  Enrique pulling QR the chair as thejknife turned in 
him ,  in him ,  Paco .  

The knife was out no \ V and he sat on the floor in tne widen -  
ing warm pool .  

Put the napkin over it .  Hold it! said Enrique .  Hold it 
tight .  I will run for the doctor .  You must hold in the 
haemorrhage .  

There should be a rubber cup ,  said Paco .  He had seen 
that used in the ring .  

I came straight ,  said Enrique ,  crying .  All I wanted was 
to show the danger .  

Dont worry ,  said Paco ,  his voice sounding far away .  
But bring the doctor .  

In the ring they lifted you and carried you ,  running with 
you ,  to the operating room .  If the femoral artery emptied 
itself before you reached there they called the priest .  



5 6 TH .  

Advise one of the priests ,  said Paco ,  holding the napkin 
tight against his lower abdomen .  He could not believe that 
this had happened to him .  

Put Enrique was running down the Carrera San Jeromino 
to the all - night first - aid station and Paco was alone ,  first 
sitting up ,  then huddled over ,  then slumped en the floor ,  
until it was over ,  feeling his life go out of him as dirty water 
empties from a bathtub when the plug is drawn .  He was 
frightened and he felt faint and he tried to say an act of 
contrition and he remembered how it started but before he 
had said ,  as fast as he could ,  Oh ,  my God ,  I am heartily 
sorry for having offended Thee who art worthy of all my 
love and I firmly resolve  .   .   .  he felt too faint and he was 
lying face down on the floor and it was over very quickly .  
A severed femoral artery empties itself faster than you can 
believe .  

As the doctor from the first - aid station came up the stairs 
accompanied by a policeman who held on to Enrique by the 
arm ,  the two sisters of Paco were still in the moving - picture 
palace of the Gran Via ,  where they were intensely dis -  
appointed in the Garbo film ,  which showed the great star in 
miserable low surroundings when they had been accustomed 
to see her surrounded by great luxury and brilliance .  The 
audience disliked the film thoroughly and were protesting 
by whistling and stamping their feet .  All the other people 
from the hotel were doing almost what they had been doing 
when the accident happened ,  except that the two priests 
had finished their devotions and were preparing for sleep ,  
and the grey - haired picador had moved his drink over to 
the table with the two houseworn prostitutes .  A little later 
he went out of the cafe with one of them .  It was the one for 
whom the matador who had lost his nerve had been buying 
drinks .  

The boy Paco had never known about any of this nor 
about what all these people would be doing on the next day 
and on other days to come .  He had no idea how they really 



THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD 57 

lived nor how they ended .  He did not even realize they 
ended .  He died ,  as the Spanish phrase has it ,  full of illu -  
sions^ 1 He had not had time in his life to lose any of them ,  
nor even ,  at the end ,  to complete an act of contrition .  

He had not even had time to be disappointed in tjie Garbo 
picture which disappointed all Madrid for a week .  



Kilimanjaro is a snow covered mountain igjiofeet high ,  and is said 
to be the highest mountain in Africa .  Its western summit is called 
the Masai Ngqje Ngai \  the House of God .  Close to the western 
summit there is the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard .  Mo one 
has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude .  



THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 

THE marvellous thing is that its painless /  he said .  Thats 
how you know when it starts .  

Is it really ?  

Absolutely .  Im awfully sorry about the odour ,  though .  
That must bother you .  

Dont! Please dont .  

Look at them /  he said .  Now is it sight or is it scent that 
brings them like that ?  

The cot the man lay on was in the wide shade of a mimosa 
tree and as he looked out past the shade on to the glare of the 
plain there were three of the big birds squatted obscenely ,  
while in the sky a dozen more sailed ,  making quick - moving 
shadows as they passed .  

Theyve been there since the day the truck broke down /  
he said .  To - days the first time any have lit on the ground .  
I watched the way they sailed very carefully at first in case 
I ever wanted to use them in a story .  Thats funny now .  

I wish you wouldnt /  she said .  

Im only talking /  he said .  Its much easier if I talk .  But 
I dont want to bother you .  

You know it doesnt bother me /  she said .  Its that Ive 
gotten so very nervous not being able to do anything .  I 
think we might make it as easy as we can until the plane 
comes .  

Or until the plane doesnt come .  

Please tell me what I can do .  There must be something 
I can do /  

58 



THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 59 .  

You can take the leg off and that might stop it ,  though I 
doubt it .  Or you can shoot me .  Youre a good shot now .  
I taftght you to shoot ,  didnt I ?  

Please dont talk that way .  Couldnt I read to you ?  

Read what ?  3 

Anythingin the book bag that we havent read .  

I cant listen to it ,  he said .  Talking is the easiest .  We 
quarrel and that makes the time pass .  5 

I dont quarrel .  I never want to quarrel .  Lets not 
quarrel any more .  No matter how nervous we get .  Maybe 
they will be back with another truck to - day .  Maybe the 
plane will come .  

I dont want to move ,  the man said .  There is no sense in 
moving now except to make it easier for you .  5 

Thats cowardly .  

Cant you let a man die as comfortably as he can without 
calling him names ?  Whats the use of slanging me ?  

Youre not going to die .  5 

Dont be silly .  Im dying now .  Ask those bastards .  He 
looked over to where the huge ,  filthy birds sat ,  their naked 
heads sunk in the hunched feathers .  A fourth planed down 
to run quick - legged and then waddle slowly toward the 
others .  

They are around every camp .  You never notice them .  
You cant die if you dont give up .  

Where did you read that ?  Youre such a bloody fool .  5 

You might think about someone else .  

For Christs sake ,  5 he said .  Thats been my trade .  5 

He lay then and was quiet for a while and looked across 
the heat shimmer of the plain to the edge of the bush .  There 
were a few Tommies that showed minute and white against 
the yellow and ,  far off ,  he saw a herd of zebra ,  white against 
the green of the bush .  This was a pleasant camp under big 
trees against a hill ,  with good water ,  and close by ,  a nearly 
dry water hole where sand grouse flighted in the mornings .  

Wouldnt you like me to read ?  5 she asked .  She was sitting 



60 THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 

on a canvas chair beside his cot .  Theres a breeze coming 
up /  

No thanks .  

Maybe the truck will come .  

I dont give a damn about the truck .  

I do .  5 

You give a damn about so many things that I dc^+  

Not so many ,  Harry .  

What about a drink ?  

Its supposed to be bad for you .  It said in Blacks to 
 . avoid all alcohol .  You shouldnt drink .  

Molo! he shouted .  

Yes ,  Bwana .  

Bring whisky - soda .  

Yes ,  Bwana .  

You shouldnt ,  she said .  Thats what I mean by giving 
up .  It says its bad for you .  I know its bad for you .  

No ,  he said .  Its good for me .  

So now it was all over ,  he thought .  So now he would 
never have a chance to finish it .  So this was the way it ended 
in a bickering over a drink .  Since the gangrene started in 
his right leg he had no pain and with the pain the horror 
had gone and all he felt now was a great tiredness and anger 
that this was the end of it .  For this ,  that now was coming ,  he 
had very little curiosity .  For years it had obsessed him ;  
but now it meant nothing in itself .  It was strange how easy 
being tired enough made it .  

Now he would never write the things that he had saved to 
write until he knew enough to write them well .  Well ,  he 
would not have to fail at trying to write them either .  Maybe 
you could never write them ,  and that was why you put them 
off and delayed the starting .  Well ,  he would never know ,  
now .  

I wish wed never come ,  the woman said .  She was 
looking at him holding the glass and biting her lip .  You 
never would have gotten anything like this in Paris .  You 



THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 61 

always said you loved Paris .  We could have stayed in Paris 
or gone anywhere .  Id have gone anywhere .  I said Id 
go anywhere you wanted .  If you wanted to shoot we could 
have gone shooting in Hungary and been comfortable .  

Your bloody money ,  he said .  

Thats noffair ,  she said .  It was always yours as much as 
mine .  I left everything and I went wherever you wanted to 
go and Ive done what you wanted to do .  But I wish wed 
never come here .  

You said you loved it .  

I did when you were all right .  But now I hate it .  I dont 
see why that had to happen to your leg .  What have we done 
to have that happen to us ?  

I suppose what I did was to forget to put iodine on it 
when I first scratched it .  Then I didnt pay any attention to 
it because I never infect .  Then ,  later ,  when it got bad ,  it was 
probably using that weak carbolic solution when the other 
antiseptics ran out that paralysed the minute blood vessels 
and started the gangrene .  He looked at her ,  What else ?  

I dont mean that .  

If we could have hired a good mechanic instead of a half -  
baked kikuyu driver ,  he would have checked the oil and 
never burned out that bearing in the truck .  

I dont mean that .  

If you hadnt left your own people ,  your goddamned Old 
Westbury ,  Saratoga ,  Palm Beach people to take me on -  .  

Why ,  I loved you .  Thats not fair .  I love you now .  Ill 
always love you .  Dont you love me ?  

No ,  said the man .  I dont think so .  I never have .  

Harry ,  what are you saying ?  Youre out of your head .  

No .  I havent any head to go out of .  

Dont drink that ,  she said .  Darling ,  please dont drink 
that .  We have to do everything we can .  

You do it ,  he said .  Im tired .  

Mow in his mind he saw a railway station at Karagatch and he 



62 THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 

was standing with his pack and that was the headlight of the 
Simplon -  Orient cutting the dark now and he was leaving Thrace then 
after the retreat .  That was one of the things he had saved to write .  ,  
wtth ,  in the morning at breakfast  ,  looking out the window and seeing 
snow on the mountains in Bulgaria and Nanseris Secretary asking 
the old man if it were snow and the old man looking dt it and saying ,  
JV0 ,  thafs not snow .  Ifs too early for snow .  And the Secretary 
repeating to the other girls ,  No ,  you see .  Ifs not snow and them all 
saying ,  Ifs not snow ,  we were mistaken .  But it was the snow all 
right and he sent them on into it when he evolved exchange of popula -  
tions .  And it was snow they tramped along in until they died that 
winter .  

It was snow too that fell all Christmas week that year up in the 
Gauertal ,  that year they lived in the woodcutters house with the big 
square porcelain stove that filled half the room ,  and they slept on 
mattresses filled with beech leaves ,  the time the deserter came with his 
feet bloody in the snow .  He said the police were right behind him and 
they gave him woollen socks and held the gendarmes talking until the 
tracks had drifted over .  

In Schrunz ,  on Christmas day ,  the snow was so bright it hurt 
your eyes when you looked out from the weinstube and saw everyone 
coming home from church .  That was where they walked up the 
sleigh - smoothed urine - yellowed road along the river with the steep 
pine hills ,  skis heavy on the shoulder ,  and where they ran that great 
run down the glacier above the Madlener - fyaus y the snow as smooth 
to see as cake frosting and as light as pdiwfev^nd he remembered 
the noiseless rush the speed made as you dropped dbwn like a bird .  

They were snow - bound a week in the Madlener - haus that time in 
the blizzard playing cards in the smoke by the lantern light and the 
stakes were higher all the time as Hen Lent lost more .  Finally he 
lost it all .  Everything ,  the skischule money and all the seasons 
profit and then his capital .  He could see him with his long nose ,  
picking up the cards and then opening ,  Sans Voir \  There was always 
gambling then .  When there was no snow you gambled and when there 
was too much you gambled .  He thought of all the time in his life he 
had spent gambling .  



THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 63 

But he had never written a line of that ,  nor of that cold ,  bright 
Christmas day with the mountains showing across the plain that 
Johnson had flown across the lines to bomb the Austrian officers leave 
train ,  machine - gunning them as they scattered and ran .  He rerr&m -  
bered Johnson afterwards coming into the mess and starting to tell 
about it .  Arid how quiet it got and then somebody saying ,  You 
bloody murderous bastard! 

Those were the same Austrians they killed then that he skied with 
later .  No ,  not the same .  Hans ,  that he skied with all that year ,  had 
been in the Kaiser - Jdgers and when they went hunting hares together 
up the little valley above the saw - mill they had talked of the fighting 
on Pasubio and of the attack on Pertica and Asalone and he had 
never written a word of that .  Nor of Monte Corno ,  nor the Siete 
Commum ,  nor of Arsiedo .  

How many winters had he lived in the Voralberg and the Arlberg ?  
It was four and then he remembered the man who had the fox to sell 
when they had walked into Bludenz ,  that time to buy presents ,  and 
the cherry pip taste of good kirsch ,  the fast - slipping rush of running 
powder - snow on crust ,  singing Hi! Ho! said Roily T as you ran 
down the last stretch to the steel drop ,  taking it straight ,  then running 
the orchard in three turns and out across the ditch and on to the icy 
road behind the inn .  Knocking your bindings loose ,  kicking the skis 
free and leaning them up against the wooden wall of the inn ,  the 
lamplight coming from the window ,  where inside ,  in the smoky ,  
new - wine smelling warmth ,  they were playing the accordion .  

Where did we stay in Paris ?  3 he asked the woman who was 
sitting by him in a canvas chair ,  now ,  in Africa .  

At the Crillon .  You know that .  

Why do I know that ?  

Thats where we always stayed .  

No .  Not always .  

There and at the Pavilion Henri - Quatre in St .  Germain .  
You said you loved it there .  

Love is a dunghill /  said Harry .  And Im the cock that 
gets on it to crow .

If you have to go away /  she said ,  is it absolutely necessary 
to kill off everything you leave behind ?  I mean do you have 
to take away everything ?  Do you have to kill your horse ,  
aiYd your wife and burn your saddle and your armour ?  5 

Yes /  be said .  Your damned money was my armour .  My 
Swift and my Armour .  

Dont .  

All right .  Ill stop that .  I dont want to hurt you .  

Its a little bit late now .  

All right then .  Ill go on hurting you .  Its more amusing .  
The only thing I ever really liked to do with you I cant do 
now .  

No ,  thats not true .  You liked to do many things and 
everything you wanted to do I did .  

Oh ,  for Christ sake stop bragging ,  will you ?  

He looked at her and saw her crying .  

Listen ,  he said .  Do you think that it is fun to do this ?  I 
dont know why Im doing it .  Its trying to kill to keep your -  
self alive ,  I imagine .  I was all right when we started talking .  
I didnt mean to start this ,  and now Im crazy as a coot and 
being as cruel to you as I can be .  Dont pay any attention ,  
darling ,  to what I say .  I love you ,  really .  You know I love 
you .  Ive never loved anyone else the way I love you .  5 

He slipped into the familiar lie he made his bread and 
butter by .  

Youre sweet to me .  

You bitch ,  he said .  You rich bitch .  Thats poetry .  Im 
full of poetry now .  Rot and poetry .  Rotten poetry .  

Stop it .  Harry ,  why do you have to turn into a devil 
now ?  

I dont like to leave anything ,  the man said .  I dont like 
to leave things behind .  

It was evening now and he had been asleep .  The sun was 
gone behind the hill and there was a shadow all across the 
plain and the small animals were feeding close to camp ;  



THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 65 

quick dropping heads and switching tails ,  he watched them 
keeping well out away from the bush now .  The birds no 
longer waited on the ground .  They were all perched heavily 
in a tree .  There were many more of them .  His personal 
boy was sitting by the bed .  

Memsahib*s gone to shoot ,  3 the boy said .  Does Bwana 
want ?  5 

Nothing .  

She had gone to kill a piece of meat and ,  knowing how he 
liked to watch the game ,  she had gone well away so she 
would not disturb this little pocket of the plain that he could 
see .  She was always thoughtful ,  he thought .  On anything 
she knew about ,  or had read ,  or that she had ever heard .  

It was not her fault that when he went to her he was 
already over .  How could a woman know that you meant 
nothing that you said ;  that you spoke only from habit and 
to be comfortable ?  After he no longer meant what he said ,  
his lies were more successful with women than when he had 
told them the truth .  

It was not so much that he lied as that there was no truth 
to tell .  He had had his life and it was over and then he 
went on living it again with different people and more 
money ,  with the best of the same places ,  and some new ones .  

You kept from thinking and it was all marvellous .  You 
 \ vere equipped with good insides so that you did not go to 
pieces that way ,  the way most of them had ,  and you made an 
attitude that you cared nothing for the work you used to do ,  
now that you could no longer do it .  But ,  in yourself ,  you 
said that you would write about these people ;  about the 
very rich ;  that you were really not of them but a spy in their 
country ;  that you would leave it and write of it and for once 
it would be written by some one who knew what he was 
writing of .  But he would never do it ,  because each day of not 
writing ,  of comfort ,  of being that which he despised ,  dulled 
his ability and softened his will to work so that ,  finally ,  he 
did no work at all .  The people he knew now were all much 



66 THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 

more comfortable when he did not work .  Africa was where 
he had been happiest in the good time of his life ,  so he had 
come out here to start again .  They had made this safari 
 \ tfith the minimum of comfort .  There was no hardship ;  
but there was no luxury and he had thought that he could 
get back into training that way .  That in some* way he could 
work the fat off his soul the way a fighter went into the 
mountains to work and train in order to burn it out of his 
body .  

She had liked it .  She said she loved it .  She loved anything 
that was exciting ,  that involved a change of scene ,  where 
there were new people and where things were pleasant .  
And he had felt the illusion of returning strength of will to 
work .  Now if this was how it ended ,  and he knew it was ,  he 
must not turn like some snake biting itself because its back 
was broken .  It wasnt this womans fault .  If it had not been 
she it would have been another .  If he lived by a lie he 
should try to die by it .  He heard a shot beyond the hill .  

She shot very well ,  this good ,  this rich bitch ,  this kindly 
caretaker and destroyer of his talent .  Nonsense .  He had 
destroyed his talent himself .  Why should he blame this 
woman because she kept him well ?  He had destroyed his 
talent by not using it ,  by betrayals of himself and what he 
believed in ,  by drinking so much that he blunted the edge 
of his perceptions ,  by laziness ,  by sloth ,  and by snobbery ,  
by pride and by prejudice ,  by hook and by crook .  What was 
this ?  A catalogue of old books ?  What was his talent any -  
way ?  It was a talent all right but instead of using it ,  he had 
traded on it .  It was never what he had done ,  but always 
what he could do .  And he had chosen to make his living with 
something else instead of a pen or a pencil .  It was strange ,  
tod ,  wasnt it ,  that when he fell in love with another woman ,  
that woman should always have more money than the last 
one ?  But when he no longer was in love ,  when he was only 
lying ,  as to this woman ,  now ,  who had the most money of 
all ,  who had all the money that was ,  who had had a husband 



THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 67 

and children ,   who had taken lovers and been dissatisfied 
with them ,  and who loved him dearly as a writer ,  as a man ,  
as a companion and as a proud possession ;  it was .  strange 
that when he did not love her at all and was lying ,  that Ire 
should be able to give her more for her money thamwhen he 
had really loVed .  

We must all be cut out for what we do ,  he thought .  How -  
ever you make your living is where your talent lies .  He had 
sold vitality ,  in one form or another ,  all his life ,  and when 
your affections are not too involved you give much better 
value for the money .  He had found that out but he would 
never write that ,  now ,  either .  No ,  he would not write that ,  
although it was well worth writing .  

Now she came in sight ,  walking across the open towards 
the camp .  She was wearing jodhpurs and carrying her rifle .  
The two boys had a Tommie slung and they were coming 
along behind her .  She was still a good - looking woman ,  he 
thought ,  and she had a pleasant body .  She had a great 
talent and appreciation for the bed ,  she was not pretty ,  but 
he liked her face ,  she read enormously ,  liked to ride and 
shoot and ,  certainly ,  she drank too much .  Her husband had 
died when she was still a comparatively young woman and 
for a while she had devoted herself to her two just - grown 
children ,  who did not need her and were embarrassed at 
having her about ,  to her stable of horses ,  to books ,  and to 
bottles .  She liked to read in the evening before dinner and 
she drank Scotch and soda while she read .  By dinner she 
was fairly drunk and after a bottle of wine at dinner she was 
usually drunk enough to sleep .  

That was before the lovers .  After she had the Ipvers she 
did not drink so much because she did not have to be drunk 
to sleep .  But the lovers bored her .  She had been married 
to a man who had never bored her and these people bored 
her very much .  

Then one of her two children was killed in a plane crash 
and after that was over she did not want the lovers ,  and drink 



68 THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 

being no anaesthetic she had to make another life .  Suddenly ,  
she had been acutely frightened of being alone .  But she 
wanted someone that she respected with her .  

% It had begun very simply .  She liked what he wrote and 
she had always envied the life he led .  She thought he did 
exactly what he wanted to .  The steps by Which she had 
acquired him and the way in which she had finally fallen in 
love with him were all part of a regular progression in which 
she had built herself a new life and he had traded away what 
remained of his old life .  

He had traded it for security ,  for comfort too ,  there was no 
denying that ,  and for what else ?  He did not know .  She 
would have brought him anything he wanted .  He knew that .  
She was a damned nice woman too .  He would as soon be in 
bed with her as anyone ;  rather with her ,  because she was 
richer ,  because she was very pleasant and appreciative 
and because she never made scenes .  And now this life that 
she had built again was coming to a term because he had not 
used iodine two weeks ago when a thorn had scratched his 
knee as they moved forward trying to photograph a herd 
of waterbuck standing ,  their heads up ,  peering while their 
nostrils searched the air ,  their ears spread wide to hear the 
first noise that would send them rushing into the bush .  
They had bolted ,  too ,  before he got the picture .  

Here she came now .  

He turned his head on the cot to look toward her .  Hello ,  
he said .  

I shot a Tommy ram ,  she told him .  Hell make you 
good broth and Ill have them mash some potatoes with the 
Klim .  How do you feel ?  

Much better .  

Isnt that lovely ?  You know I thought perhaps you 
would .  You were sleeping >vhen I left .  

I had a good sleep .  Did you walk far ?  5 

No .  Just around behind the hill .  I made quite a good 
shot on the Tommy .  



THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 69 

You shoot marvellously ,  you know .  5 

I love it .  Ive loved Africa .  Really .  If youre all right its 
the most fun that Ive ever had .  You dont know the fun its 
been to shoot with you .  Ive loved the country .  

I love it too .  r 

Darling ,  you dont know how marvellous it is to see you 
feeling better .  I couldnt stand it when you felt that way .  
You wont talk to me like that again ,  will you ?  Promise 
me ?  

No ,  he said .  I dont remember what I said .  

You dont have to destroy me .  Do you ?  Im only a 
middle - aged woman who loves you and wants to do what you 
want to do .  Ive been destroyed two or three times already .  
You wouldnt want to destroy me again ,  would you ?  

Td like to destroy you a few times in bed ,  he said .  

Yes .  Thats the good destruction .  Thats the way were 
made to be destroyed .  The plane will be here to - morrow .  

How do you know ?  

Tm sure .  Its bound to come .  The boys have the wood all 
ready and the grass to make the smudge .  I went down and 
looked at it again to - day .  Theres plenty of room to land and 
we have the smudges ready at both ends .  

What makes you think it will come to - morrow ?  

Im sure it will .  Its overdue now .  Then ,  in town ,  they 
will fix up your leg and then we will have some good 
destruction .  Not that dreadful talking kind .  

Should we have a drink ?  The sun is down .  

Do you think you should ?  

Tm having one .  

Well have one together .  Molo ,  letti dui whisky - soda! she 
called .  

Youd better put on your mosquito boots ,  he told her .  

Til wait till I bathe  .   .   .  

While it grew dark they drank and just before it was dark 
and there was no longer enough light to shoot ,  a hyena 
crossed the open on his way around the hill .  



70 THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 

That bastard crosses there every night /  the man said .  
Every night for two weeks /  

Hes the one makes the noise at night .  I dont mind it .  
Theyre a filthy animal though .  

Drinking together ,  with no pain now except the discomfort 
of lying in the one position ,  the boys lighting a fire ,  its 
shadow jumping on the tents ,  he could feel the return of 
acquiescence in this life of pleasant surrender .  She was very 
good to him .  He had been cruel and unjust in the afternoon .  
She was a fine woman ,  marvellous really .  And just then it 
occurred to him that he was going to die .  

It came with a rush ;  not as a rush of water nor of wind ;  but 
of a sudden evil - smelling emptiness and the odd thing was 
that the hyena slipped lightly along the edge of it .  

What is it ,  Harry ?  she asked him .  

Nothing ,  he said .  You had better move over to the 
other side .  To windward .  

Did Molo change the dressing ?  

Yes .  Im just using the boric now .  

How do you feel ?  

A little wobbly .  

Im going in to bathe ,  she said .  Til be right out .  Ill eat 
with you and then well put the cot in .  

So ,  he said to himself ,  we did well to stop the quarrelling .  
He had never quarrelled much with this woman ,  while with 
the women that he loved he had quarrelled so much they had 
finally ,  always ,  with the corrosion of the quarrelling ,  killed 
what they had together .  He had loved too much ,  demanded 
too much ,  and he wore it all out .  

He thought about alone in Constantinople that time ,  having 
quarrelled in Paris before he had gone out .  He had whored the whole 
time and then ,  when that was over ,  and he had failed to kill his 
loneliness ,  but only made it worse ,  he had written her ,  the first one ,  
tht one who left him ,  a letter telling her how he had never been able 
to kill it  .   .   .  How when he thought he saw her outside the Regence 



THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 71 

one time it made him go all faint and sick inside ,  and that he would 
follow a woman who looked like her in some way ,  along the Boulevard ,  
afraid to see it was not she ,  afraid to lose the feeling it gave him .  
How everyone he had slept with had only made him miss her mofe .  
How what she had done could never matter since he knew he could 
not cure himself of loving her .  He wrote this letter at the Club ,  cold 
sober ,  and mailed it to New York asking her to write him at the 
office in Paris .  That seemed safe .  And that night missing her so 
much it made him feel hollow sick inside ,  he wandered up past 
Taxings ,  picked a girl up and took her out to supper .  He had gone 
to a place to dance with her afterwards ,  she danced badly ,  and left 
her for a hot Armenian slut ,  that swung her belly against him so it 
almost scalded .  He took her away from a British gunner subaltern 
after a row .  The gunner asked him outside and they fought in the 
street on the cobbles in the dark .  Hed hit him twice ,  hard ,  on the 
side of the jaw and when he didnt go down he knew he was in for a 
fight .  The gunner hit him in the body ,  then beside his eye .  He swung 
with his left again and landed and the gunner fell on him and 
grabbed his coat and tore the sleeve off and he clubbed him twice 
behind the ear and then smashed him with his right as he pushed him 
away .  When the gunner went down his head hit first and he ran 
with the girl because they heard the M . P . s coming .  They got into a 
taxi and drove out to Rimmily Hissa along the Bosphorus ,  and 
around ,  and back in the cool night and went to bed and she felt as 
over - ripe as she looked but smooth ,  rose - petal ,  syrupy ,  smooth -  
bellied ,  big - breasted and needed no pillow under her buttocks ,  and he 
left her before she was awake looking blousy enough in the fast 
daylight and turned up at the Pera Palace with a black eye ,  carrying 
his coat because one sleeve was missing .  

That same night he left for Anatolia and he remembered ,  later on 
that trip ,  riding all day through fields of the poppies that they raised 
for opium and how strange it made you feel ,  finally ,  and all the 
distances seemed wrong ,  to where they had made the attack with the 
newly - arrived Constantine officers ,  that did not know a god - damned 
thing ,  and the artillery had fired into the troops and the British 
observer had cried like a child .  



72 THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 

That was the day hed first seen dead men wearing white ballet 
skirts and upturned shoes with pompoms on them .  The Turks had 
come steadily and lumpily and he had seen the skirted men running 
and the officers shooting into them and running then themselves and 
he and the British observer had run too until his lungs ached and his 
mouth was full of the taste of pennies and they stopped behind some 
rocks and there were the Turks coming as lumpily as ever .  Later 
he had seen the things that he could never think of and later still he 
had seen ,  much worse .  So when he got back to Paris that time he 
could not talk about it or stand to have it mentioned .  And there in the 
cafe as he passed was that American poet with a pile of saucers in 
front of him and a stupid look on his potato face talking about the 
Dada movement with a Roumanian who said his name was Tristan 
Tzarti ,  who always wore a monocle and had a headache ,  and ,  back 
at the apartment with his wife that now he loved again ,  the quarrel 
all over ,  the madness all over ,  glad to be home ,  the office sent his 
mail up to the flat .  So then the letter in answer to the one hed written 
came in on a platter one morning and when he saw the hand - writing 
he went cold all over and tried to slip the letter underneath another .  
But his wife said ,  Who is that letter from ,  dear ?  and that was the 
end of the beginning of that .  

He remembered the good times with them all ,  and the quarrels .  
They always picked the finest places to have the quarrels .  And why 
had they always quarrelled when he was feeling best ?  He had never 
written any of that because ,  at first ,  he never wanted to hurt anyone 
and then it seemed as though there was enough to write without it .  
But he had always thought that he would write it finally .  There was 
so much to write .  He had seen the world change ;  not just the events ;  
although he had seen many of them and had watched the people ,  but 
he had seen the subtler change and he could remember how the people 
were at different times .  He had been in it and he had watched it and it 
was his duty to write of it ;  but now he never would .  

How do you feel ?  she said .  She had come out from the 
tent now after her bath .  
All right .  



THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 73 

Gould you eat now ?  He saw Molo behind her with the 
folding table and the other boy with the dishes .  

I want to write ,  he said .  

You ought to take some broth to keep your strength up . i  ,  

Im going to die to - night ,  he said .  I dont need my 
strength up .  

Dont be melodramatic ,  Harry ,  please /  she said .  

Why dont you use your nose ?  Im rotted half - way up my 
thigh now .  What the hell should I fool with broth for ?  
Molo ,  bring whisky - soda .  

Please take the broth ,  she said gently .  

All right .  

The broth was too hot .  He had to hold it in the cup until it 
cooled enough to take it and then he just got it down without 
gagging .  

Youre a fine woman ,  he said .  Dont pay any attention 
to me .  

She looked at him with her well - known ,  well - loved face 
from Spur and Town and Country ,  only a little the worse for 
drink ,  only a little the worse for bed ,  but Town and Country 
never showed those good breasts and those useful thighs and 
those lightly small - of - back caressing hands ,  and as he looked 
and saw her well - known pleasant smile ,  he felt death come 
again .  This time there was no rush .  It was a puff ,  as of a 
wind that makes a candle flicker and the flame go tall .  

They can bring my net out later and hang it from the tree 
and build the fire up .  Im not going in the tent to - night .  
Its not worth moving .  Its a clear night .  There wont be 
any rain .  

So this was how you died ,  in whispers that you did not 
hear .  Well ,  there would be no more quarrelling .  He 
could promise that .  The one experience that he had never 
had he was not going to spoil now .  He probably would .  
You spoiled everything .  But perhaps he wouldnt .  

You cant take dictation ,  can you ?  

I never learned ,  she told him .  



74 THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 

Thats all right .  

There wasnt time ,  of course ,  although it seemed as though 
it telescoped so that you might put it all into one paragraph if 
you could get it right .  

There was a log house ,  chinked white with mortar^ on a hill above 
the lake .  There was a bell on a pole by the door to call the people 
in to meals .  Behind the house were fields and behind the fields was 
the timber .  A line of lombardy poplars ran from the house to the 
dock .  Other poplars ran along the point .  A road went up to the hills 
along the edge of the timber and along that road he picked black -  
berries .  Then that log house was burned down and all the guns 
that had been on deer foot racks above the open fire place were burned 
and afterwards their barrels ,  with the lead melted in the magazines ,  
and the stocks burned away ,  lay out on the heap of ashes that were 
used to make lye for the big iron soap kettles ,  and you asked Grand -  
father if you could have them to play with ,  and he said ,  no .  Ton 
see they were his guns still and he never bought any others .  JVbr did 
he hunt any more .  The house was rebuilt in the same place out of 
lumber now and painted white and from its porch you saw the 
poplars and the lake beyond ;  but there were never any more guns .  
The barrels of the guns that had hung on the deer feet on the wall 
of the log house lay out there on the heap of ashes and no one ever 
touched them .  

In the Black Forest ,  after the war ,  we rented a trout stream and 
there were two ways to walk to it .  One was down the valley from 
Triberg and around the valley road in the shade of the trees that 
bordered the white road ,  and then up a side road that went up 
through the hills ,  past many small farms ,  with the big Schwarzwald 
houses ,  until that road crossed the stream .  That was where our 
fishing began .  

The other way was to climb steeply up to the edge of the woods and 
then go across the top of the hills through the pine woods ,  and then out 
to the edge of a meadow and down across this meadow to the bridge .  
There were birches along the stream and it was not big ,  but narrow ,  
clear and fast ,  with pools where it had cut under the roots of the 



THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 75 

birches .  At the Hotel in Triberg the proprietor had a fine season .  
It was very pleasant and we were all great friends .  The next year 
came the inflation and the money he had made the year before was not 
enough to buy supplies to open the hotel and he hanged himself .  

You could dictate that ,  but you could not dictate the Place Contre -  
scarpe where the flower sellers dyed their flowers in the street and the 
dye ran over the paving where the autobus started and the old men 
and the women ,  always drunk on wine and bad marc ;  and the children 
with their noses running in the cold ;  the smell of dirty sweat and 
poverty and drunkenness at the Cafe des Amateurs and the whores 
at the Bal Musette they lived above .  The Concierge who entertained 
the trooper of the Garde Republicaine in her loge ,  his horse - hair -  
plumed helmet on a chair .  The locataire across the hall whose 
husband was a bicycle racer and her joy that morning at the Cremerie 
when she had opened LAuto and seen where he placed third in 
Paris - Tours ,  his first big race .  She had blushed and laughed and 
then gone upstairs crying with the yellow sporting paper in her hand .  
The husband of the woman who ran the Bal Musette drove a taxi 
and when he ,  Harry ,  had to take an early plane the husband knocked 
upon the door to wake him and they each drank a glass of white wine 
at the zinc of the bar before they started .  He knew his neighbours 
in that quarter then because they all were poor .  

Around that Place there were two kinds: the drunkards and the 
sportifs .  The drunkards killed their poverty that way ;  the sportifs 
took it out in exercise .  They were the descendants of the Com -  
munards and it was no struggle for them to know their politics .  
They knew who had shot their fathers ,  their relatives ,  their brothers ,  
and their friends when the Versailles troops came in and took the 
town after the Commune and executed anyone they could catch with 
calloused hands ,  or who wore a cap ,  or carried any other sign he was 
a working man .  And in that poverty ,  and in that quarter across the 
street from a Boucherie Chevaline and a wine - co - operative he had 
written the start of all he was to do .  There never was another part 
of Paris that he loved like that ,  the sprawling trees ,  the old white 
plastered houses painted brown below ,  the long green of the autobus 
in that round square ,  the purple flower dye upon the paving ,  the 



76 THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 

sudden drop down the hill of the rue Cardinal Lemoine to the River ,  
and the other way the narrow crowded world of the rue Mouffetard .  
The street that ran up toward the Pantheon and the other that he 
always took with the bicycle ,  the only asphalted street in all that 
quarter ,  smooth under the tyres ,  with the high narrow houses and the 
cheap tall ~hotel where Paul Verlaine had died .  There were only two 
rooms in the apartments where they lived and he had a room on the 
top floor of that hotel that cost him sixty francs a month where he 
did his writing ,  and from it he could see the roofs and chimney pots 
and all the hills of Paris .  

From the apartment you could only see the wood and coal mans 
plate .  He sold wine ,  too ,  bad wine .  The golden horses head 
outside the Boucherie Chevaline where the carcasses hung yellow gold 
and red in the open window ,  and the green painted co - operative 
where they bought their wine ;  good wine and cheap .  The rest was 
plaster walls and the windows of the neighbours .  The neighbours 
who ,  at night ,  when someone lay drunk in the street ,  moaning and 
groaning in that typical French ivresse that you were propaganded 
to believe did not exist ,  would open their windows and then the 
murmur of talk .  

Where is the policeman ?  When you dont want him the bugger 
is always there .  Hes sleeping with some concierge .  Get the Agent .  
Till someone threw a bucket of water from a window and the moaning 
stopped .  Whats that ?  Water .  Ah ,  thats intelligent And the 
windows shutting .  Marie ,  hisfemme de menage ,  protesting against 
the eight - hour day saying ,  If a husband works until six he gets only 
a little drunk on the way home and does not waste too much .  If he 
works only until Jive he is drunk every night and one has no money .  
It is the wife of the working man who suffers from this shortening of 
hours 

Wouldnt you like some more broth ?  the woman asked 
now .  

No ,  thank you very much .  It is awfully good .  5 

Try just a little .  

I would like a whisky - soda .  



THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 77 

Its not good for you .  

No .  Its bad for me .  Cole Porter wrote the words and the 
music .  This knowledge that youre going mad for me .  

You know I like you to drink .  

Oh yes .  Only its bad for me .  

When she goes ,  he thought .  Ill have all I want .  Not all I 
want but all there is .  Ayee ,  he was tired .  Too tired .  He was 
going to sleep a little while .  He lay still and death was not 
there .  It must have gone around another street .  It went in 
pairs ,  on bicycles ,  and moved absolutely silently on the 
pavements .  

No ,  he had never written about Paris .  Not the Paris that he cared 
about .  But what about the rest that he had never written ?  

What about the ranch and the silvered grey of the sage brush ,  the 
quick ,  clear water in the irrigation ditches ,  and the heavy green of the 
alfalfa ?  The trail went up into the hills and the cattle in the summer 
were shy as deer .  The bawling and the steady noise and slow moving 
mass raising a dust as you brought them down in the fall .  And behind 
the mountains ,  the clear sharpness of the peak in the evening light and ,  
riding down along the train in the moonlight ,  bright across the valley .  
Now he remembered coming down through the timber in the dark 
holding the horses tail when you could not see and all the stories that 
he meant to write .  

About the half  - wit chore boy who was .  left at the ranch that time 
and told not to let any one get any hay ,  and that old bastard from the 
Forks who had beaten the boy when he had worked for him stopping 
to get some feed .  The boy refusing and the old man saying he would 
beat him again .  The boy got the rifle from the kitchen and shot him 
when he tried to come into the barn and when they came back to the 
ranch hed been dead a week ,  frozen in the corral ,  and the dogs had 
eaten part of him .  But what was left you packed on a sled wrapped in 
a blanket and roped on and you got the boy to help you haul it ,  and 
the two of you took it out over the road on skis ,  and sixty miles down 
to town to turn the boy over .  He having no idea that he would be 
arrested .  Thinking he had done his duty and that you were his 



78 THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 

friend and he would be rewarded .  Hed helped to haul the old man 
in so everybody could know how bad the old man had been ,  and how 
hed tried to steal some feed that didnt belong to him ,  and when the 
sheriff put the handcuffs on the boy he couldnt believe it .  Then hed 
started to cry .  That was one story he had saved to write .  He knew 
at least twenty good stories from out there and he had never written 
one .  Why ?  

You tell them why ,  he said .  

Why what ,  dear ?  

Why nothing .  

She didnt drink so much ,  now ,  since she had him .  But if 
he lived he would never write about her ,  he knew that now .  
Nor about any of them .  The rich were dull and they drank 
too much ,  or they played too much backgammon .  They 
were dull and they were repetitious .  He remembered poor 
Julian and his romantic awe of them and how he had started 
a story once that began ,  The very rich are different from 
you and me .  And how someone had said to Julian .  Yes ,  they 
have more money .  But that was not humorous to Julian .  
He thought they were a special glamorous race and when 
he found they werent it wrecked him just as much as any 
other thing that wrecked him .  

He had been contemptuous of those who wrecked .  You 
did not have to like it because you understood it .  He could 
beat anything ,  he thought ,  because nothing could hurt him 
if he did not care .  

All right .  Now he would not care for death .  One thing he 
had always dreaded was the pain .  He could stand pain as 
well as any man ,  until it went on too long ,  and wore him out ,  
but here he had something that had hurt frightfully and just 
when he had felt it breaking him ,  the pain had stopped .  

He remembered long ago when Williamson ,  the bombing officer ,  
had been hit by a stick bomb some one in a German patrol had thrown 
as he was coming in through the wire that night and ,  screaming ,  had 



THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 79 

begged everyone to kill him .  He was a fat man ,  very brave ,  and a good 
officer ,  although addicted to fantastic shows .  But that night he was 
caught in the wire ,  with a flare lighting him up and his bowels spilled 
out into the wire ,  so when they brought him in ,  alive ,  they had to cut 
him loose .  Shoot me ,  Harry .  For Christ sake shoot me .  They had 
had an argument one time about our Lord never sending you anything 
you could not bear and someones theory had been that meant that a 
certain time the pain passed you out automatically .  But he had always 
remembered Williamson ,  that night .  Nothing passed out Williamson 
until he gave him all his morphine tablets that he had always saved 
to use himself and then they did not work right away .  

Still this now ,  that he had ,  was very easy ;  and if it was no 
worse as it went on there was nothing to worry about .  Except 
that he would rather be in better company .  

He thought a little about the company that he would like 
to have .  

No ,  he thought ,  when everything you do ,  you do too long ,  
and do too late ,  you cant expect to find the people still there .  
The people are all gone .  The partys over and you are with 
your hostess now .  

Im getting as bored with dying as with everything else ,  he 
thought .  

Its a bore ,  he said out loud .  

What is ,  my dear ?  

Anything you do too bloody long .  

He looked at her face between him and the fire .  She was 
leaning back in the chair and the firelight shone on her 
pleasantly lined face and he could see that she was sleepy .  
He heard the hyena make a noise just outside the range of 
the fire .  

Ive been writing ,  he said .  But I got tired /  

Do you think you will be able to sleep ?  

Pretty sure .  Why dont you turn in ?  

I like to sit here with you .  5 

Do you feel anything strange ?  he asked her .  



8o THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 

No .  Just a little sleepy .  

I do ,  he said .  

He had just felt death come by again .  

You know the only thing Ive never lost is curiosity /  he 
said to her .  

Youve never lost anything .  Youre the most complete 
man Ive ever known .  

Christ /  he said .  How little a woman knows .  What is 
that ?  Your intuition ?  

Because ,  just then ,  death had come and rested its head on 
the foot of the cot and he could smell its breath .  

Never believe any of that about a scythe and a skull ,  he 
told her .  It can be two bicycle policemen as easily or be a 
bird .  Or it can have a wide snout like a hyena .  

It had moved up on him now ,  but it had no shape any 
more .  It simply occupied space .  

Tell it to go away .  

It did not go away but moved a little closer .  

Youve got a hell of a breath /  he told it .  You stinking 
bastard .  

It moved up closer to him still and now he could not speak 
to it ,  and when it saw he could not speak it came a little closer ,  
and now he tried to send it away without speaking ,  but it 
moved in on him so its weight was all upon his chest ,  and 
while it crouched there and he could not move ,  or speak ,  he 
heard the woman say ,  Bwana is asleep now .  Take the cot 
up very gently and carry it into the tent .  

He could not speak to tell her to make it go away and it 
crouched now ,  heavier so he Could not breathe .  And then ,  
while they lifted the cot ,  suddenly it was all right and the 
weight went from his chest .  

It was morning and had been morning for some time and 
he heard the plane .  It showed very tiny and then made a 
wide circle and the boys ran out and lit the fires ,  using kero -  
sene ,  and piled on grass so there were two big smudges at each 



THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 81 

a 

end of the level place and the morning breeze blew them 
toward the camp and the plane circled twice more ,  low this 
time ,  and then glided down and levelled off and landed 
smoothly and ,  coming walking toward him ,  was old Comp -  
ton in slacks ,  a tweed jacket and a brown felt hat .  

Whats th matter ,  old cock ?  5 Compton said .  

Bad leg ,  he told him .  Will you have some breakfast ?  

Thanks .  Ill just have some tea .  Its the Puss Moth ,  you 
know .  I wont be able to take the Memsahib .  Theres only 
room for one .  Your lorry is on the way .  

Helen had taken Compton aside and was speaking to him .  
Compton came back more cheery than ever .  

Well get you right in ,  he said .  Til be back for the Mem .  
Now Im afraid Ill have to stop at Arusha to refuel .  Wed 
better get going .  

What about the tea ?  

I dont really care about it ,  you know .  5 

The boys had picked up the cot and carried it around the 
green tents and down along the rock and out on to the plain 
and along past the smudges that were burning brightly now ,  
the grass all consumed ,  and the wind fanning the fire ,  to the 
little plane .  It was difficult getting him in ,  but once in he lay 
back in the leather seat ,  and the leg was stuck straight out to 
one side of the seat where Compton sat .  Compton started the 
motor and got in .  He waved to Helen and to the boys and ,  as 
the clatter moved into the old familiar roar ,  they swung 
around with Compie watching for wart - hog holes and roared ,  
bumping ,  along the stretch between the fires and with the 
last bump rose and he saw them all standing below ,  waving ,  
and the camp beside the hill ,  flattening now ,  and the plain 
spreading ,  clumps of trees ,  and the bush flattening ,  while the 
game trails ran now smoothly to the dry waterholes ,  and 
there was a new water that he had never known of .  The 
zebra ,  small rounded backs now ,  and the wildebeeste ,  big -  
headed dots seeming to climb as they moved in long fingers 
across the plain ,  now scattering as the shadow came toward 



82 THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 

them ,  they were tiny now ,  and the movement had no gallop ,  
and the plain as far as you could see ,  grey - yellow now and 
ahead old Compies tweed back and the brown felt hat .  Then 
they were over the first hills and the wildebeeste were trail -  
ing up them ,  and then they were over mountains with sud -  
den depths of green - rising forest and the solid bamboo slopes ,  
and then the heavy forest again ,  sculptured into peaks and 
hollows until they crossed ,  and hills sloped down and then 
another plain ,  hot now ,  and purple brown ,  bumpy with heat 
and Compie looking back to see how he was riding .  Then 
there were other mountains dark ahead .  

And then instead of going on to Arusha they turned left ,  
he evidently figured that they had the gas ,  and looking down 
he saw a pink sifting cloud ,  moving over the ground ,  and in 
the air ,  like the first snow in a blizzard ,  that comes from 
nowhere ,  and he knew the locusts were coming up from the 
South .  Then they began to climb and they were going to the 
East it seemed ,  and then it darkened and they were in a 
storm ,  the rain so thick it seemed like flying through a water -  
fall ,  and then they were out and Compie turned his head and 
grinned and pointed and there ,  ahead ,  all he could see ,  as 
wide as all the world ,  great ,  high ,  and unbelievably white 
in the sun ,  was the square top of Kilimanjaro .  And then he 
knew that there was where he was going .  

Just then the hyena stopped whimpering in the night and 
started to make a strange ,  human ,  almost crying sound .  The 
woman heard it and stirred uneasily .  She did not waks .  In 
her dream she was at the house on Long Island and it was the 
night before her daughters debut .  Somehow her father was 
there and he had been very rude .  Then the noise the hyena 
made was so loud she woke and for a moment she did not 
know where she was and she was very afraid .  Then she took 
the flashlight and shone it on the other cot that they had 
carried in after Harry had gone to sleep .  She could see his 
bulk under the mosquito bar but somehow he had gotten his 



THE SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO 83 

leg out and it hung down alongside the cot .  The dressings 
had all come down and she could not look at it .  

Molo ,  she called .  Molo! Molo! 

Then she said ,  Harry ,  Harry! Then her voice rising ,  
Harry! Please ,  Oh Harry! 5 

There was no answer and she could not hear him breathing .  

Outside the tent the hyena made the same strange noise 
that had awakened her .  But she did not hear him for the 
beating of her heart .  



* 
OLD MAN AT THE BRIDGE 

AN old man with steel rimmed spectacles and very dusty 
clothes sat by the side of the road .  There was a pontoon 
bridge arjoss the river and carts ,  trucks ,  and men ,  women 
and children were crossing it .  The mule - drawn carts stag -  
gered up the steep bank from the bridge with soldiers helping 
push against the spokes of the wheels .  The trucks ground up 
and away heading out of it all and the peasants plodded along 
in the ankle deep dust .  But the old man sat there without 
moving .  He was too tired to go any farther .  

It was my business to cross the bridge ,  explore the bridge -  
head beyond and find out to what point the enemy had 
advanced .  I did this and returned over the bridge .  There 
were not so many carts now and very few people on foot ,  
but the old man was still there .  

Where do you come from ?  I asked him .  

From San Carlos /  he said ,  and smiled .  

That was his native town and so it gave him pleasure to 
mention it and he smiled .  

I was taking care of animals ,  he explained .  

Oh ,  I said ,  not quite understanding .  

Yes ,  he said ,  I stayed ,  you see ,  taking care of animals .  I 
was the last one to leave the town of San Carlos .  

He did not look like a shepherd nor a herdsman and I 
looked at his black dusty clothes and his grey dusty face and 
his steel rimmed spectacles and said ,  What animals were 
they ?  

Various animals ,  he said ,  and shook his head .  I had to 
leave them .  

I was watching the bridge and the African looking country 
of the Ebro Delta and wondering how long now it would be 
before we would see the enemy ,  and listening all the while for 
the first noises that would signal that ever mysterious event 
called contact ,  and the old man still sat there .  

What animals were they ?  I asked .  

84 



OLD MAN AT THE BRIDGE 85 

There were three animals altogether ,  he explained .  
There were two goats and a cat and then there were four 
pairs of pigeons .  

And you had to leave them ?  I asked .  

Yes .  Because of the artillery .  The captain told me to go 
because of the artillery .  

And you have no family ?  I asked ,  watching the far end of 
the bridge where a few last carts were hurrying down the 
slope of the bank .  

No ,  he said ,  only the animals I stated .  The cat ,  of course ,  
will be all right .  A cat can look out for itself ,  but I cannot 
think what will become of the others .  

What politics have you ?  I asked .  

T am without politics ,  he said .  I am seventy - six years old .  
I have come twelve kilometres now and I think now I can go 
no farther .  

This is not a good place to stop ,  I said .  If you can make 
it ,  there are trucks up the road where it forks for Tortosa .  

I will wait a while ,  he said ,  and then I will go .  Where do 
the trucks go ?  

Towards Barcelona ,  I told him .  

I know of no one in that direction ,  he said ,  but thank you 
very much .  Thank you again very much .  

He looked at me very blankly and tiredly ,  then said ,  having 
to share his worry with someone ,  The cat will be all right ,  
I am sure .  There is no need to be unquiet about the cat .  But 
the others .  Now what do you think about the others ?  

Why ,  theyll probably come through it all right .  

You think so ?  

Why not ?  I said ,  watching the far bank where now there 
were no carts .  

But what will they do under the artillery when I was told 
to leave because of the artillery ?  5 

Did you leave the dove cage unlocked ?  I asked .  

Yes .  

Then theyll fly .  



86 OLDMANATTHEBRIDGE 

Yes ,  certainly theyll fly .  But the others .  Its better not to 
think about the others /  he said .  

If you are rested I would go /  I urged .  Get up and try to 
walk now .  

Thank you /  he said and got to his feet ,  swayed from side 
to side and then sat down ,  backwards in the du!st .  

I was taking care of animals /  he said dully ,  but no longer 
to me .  I was only taking care of animals .  

There was nothing to do about him .  It was Easter Sunday 
and the Fascists were advancing toward the Ebro .  It was a 
grey overcast day with a low ceiling so their planes were not 
up .  That and the fact that cats know how to look after them -  
selves was all the good luck that old man would ever have .  



ON THE QUAI AT SMYRNA 

THE strange thing was ,  he said ,  how they screamed every 
night at midnight .  I do not know why they screamed at thc*t 
time .  We were in the harbour and they were all on .  the pier 
and at midnight they started screaming .  We used to turn the 
searchlight on them to quiet them .  That always did the trick .  
Wed run the searchlight up and down over them two or 
three times and they stopped it .  One time I was senior officer 
on the pier and a Turkish officer came up to me in a frightful 
rage because one of our sailors had been most insulting to 
him .  So I told him the fellow would be sent on ship and be 
most severely punished .  I asked him to point him out .  So he 
pointed out a gunners mate ,  most inoffensive chap .  Said 
hed been most frightfully and repeatedly insulting ;  talking 
to me through an interpreter .  I couldnt imagine how the 
gunners mate knew enough Turkish to be insulting .  I called 
him over and said ,  And just in case you should have spoken 
to any Turkish officers .  

I havent spoken to any of them ,  sir .  

Im quite sure of it ,  I said ,  but youd best go on board 
ship and not come ashore again for the rest of the day .  

Then I told the Turk the man was being sent on board 
ship and would be most severely dealt with .  Oh ,  most 
rigorously .  He felt topping about it .  Great friends we were .  

The worst ,  he said ,  were the women with dead babies .  You 
couldnt get the women to give up their dead babies .  
Theyd have babies dead for six days .  Wouldnt give them 
up .  Nothing you could do .  about it .  Had to take them away 
finally .  Then there was an old lady ,  most extraordinary case .  
I told it to a doctor and he said I was lying .  We were clear -  
ing them off the pier ,  had to clear off the dead ones ,  and this 
old woman was lying on a sort of litter .  They said ,  Will you 
have a look at her ,  sir ?  So I had a look at her and just then 
she died and went absolutely stiff .  Her legs drew up and she 
drew up from the waist and went quite rigid .  Exactly as 

93 



94 ON THE QUAIAT SMYRNA 

though she had been dead over night .  She was quite dead 
and absolutely rigid .  I told a medical chap about it and he 
told me it was impossible .  

^ They were all out there on the pier and it wasnt at all like 
an earthquake or that sort of thing because they never knew 
about the Turk .  They never knew what the old Turk would 
do .  You remember when they ordered us not to come in to 
take off any more ?  I had the wind up when we came in that 
morning .  He had any amount of batteries and could have 
blown us clean out of the water .  We were going to come in ,  
run close along the pier ,  let go the front and rear anchors and 
then shell the Turkish quarter of the town .  They would have 
blown us out of water but we would have blown the town 
simply to hell .  They just fired a few blank charges at us as 
we came in .  Kemal came down and sacked the Turkish com -  
mander .  For exceeding his authority or some such thing .  
He got a bit above himself .  It would have been the hell of a 
mess .  

You remember the harbour .  There were plenty of nice 
things floating around in it .  That was the only time in my 
life I got so I dreamed about things .  You didnt mind the 
women who were having babies as you did those with the 
dead ones .  They had them all right .  Surprising how few 
of them died .  You just covered them over with something 
and let them go to it .  Theyd always pick out the darkest 
place in the hold to have them .  None of them minded any -  
thing once they got off the pier .  

The Greeks were nice chaps too .  When they evacuated 
they had all their baggage animals they couldnt take off 
with them so they just broke their forelegs and dumped them 
into the shallow water .  All those mules with their forelegs 
broken pushed over into the shallow water .  It was all a 
pleasant business .  My word ,  yes ,  a most pleasant business .  



IN OUR TIME 

Everybody was drunk .  The whole battery was drunk going along the 
road in the dark .  We were going to the Champagne .  The lieutenant 
kept riding his horse out into the fields and saying to him ,  Tm drunk ,  I 
tell you ,  mon vioux .  Oh ,  I am so soused .  We went along the road all 
night in the dark and the adjutant kept riding up alongside my kitchen 
and saying ,   You must put it out .  It is dangerous .  It will be observed*  .  
We were fifty kilometres from the front but the adjutant worried about 
the fire in my kitchen .  It was funny going along that road .  That was 
when I was a kitchen corporal .  



INDIAN CAMP 

AT the lake shore there was another rowboat drawn up .  The 
two Indians stood waiting .  

Nick and his father got in the stern of the boat and the 
Indians shoved it off and one of them got in to row .  Uncle 
George sat in the stern of the camp rowboat .  The young 
Indian shoved the camp boat off and got in to row Uncle 
George .  

The two boats started off in the dark .  Nick heard the oar -  
locks of the other boat quite a way ahead of them in the mist .  
The Indians rowed with quick choppy strokes .  Nick lay back 
with his fathers arm around him .  It was cold on the water .  
The Indian who was rowing them was working very hard ,  
but the other boat moved farther ahead in the mist all 
the time .  

Where are we going .  Dad ?  Nick asked .  

Over to the Indian camp .  There is an Indian lady very 
sick .  

Oh /  said Nick .  

Across the bay they found the other boat beached .  Uncle 
George was smoking a cigar in the dark .  The young Indian 

95 



96 INDIAN CAMP 

pulled the boat way up on the beach .  Uncle George gave 
both the Indians cigars .  

They walked up from the beach through a meadow that 
was soaking wet with dew ,  following the young Indian who 
carried a lantern .  Then they went into the woods and fol -  
lowed a trail that led to the logging road that ran back into 
the hills .  It was much lighter on the logging road as the 
timber was cut away on both sides .  The young Indian 
stopped and blew out his lantern and they all walked on 
along the road .  

They came around a bend and a dog came out barking .  
Ahead were the lights of the shanties where the Indian bark -  
peelers lived .  More dogs rushed out at them .  The two 
Indians sent them back to the shanties .  In the shanty nearest 
the road there was a light in the window .  An old woman 
stood in the doorway holding a lamp .  

Inside on a wooden bunk lay a young Indian woman .  She 
had been trying to have her baby for two days .  All the old 
women in the camp had been helping her .  The men had 
moved off up the road to sit in the dark and smoke out of 
range of the noise she made .  She screamed just as Nick and 
the two Indians followed his father and Uncle George into 
the shanty .  She lay in the lower bunk ,  very big under a 
quilt .  Her head was turned to one side .  In the upper bunk 
was her husband .  He had cut his foot very badly with an 
axe three days before .  He was smoking a pipe .  The room 
smelled very bad .  

Nicks father ordered some water to be put on the stove ,  
and while it was heating he spoke to Nick .  

This lady is going to have a baby ,  Nick ,  he said .  

I know ,  5 said Nick .  

You dont know ,  said his father .  Listen to me .  What she 
is going through is called being in labour .  The baby wants 
to be born and she wants it to be born .  All her muscles are 
trying to get the baby born .  That is what is happening when 
she screams .  



INDIAN CAMP 97 

I see ,  Nick said .  

Just then the woman cried out .  

Oh ,  Daddy ,  cant you give her something to make her 
stop screaming ?  asked Nick .   .  

No .  I havent any anaesthetic ,  his father said .  But her 
screams are not important .  I dont hear them because they 
are not important .  

The husband in the upper bunk rolled over against the wall .  

The woman in the kitchen motioned to the doctor that the 
water was hot .  Nicks father went into the kitchen and 
poured about half of the water out of the big kettle into a 
basin .  Into the water left in the kettle he put several things 
he unwrapped from a handkerchief .  

Those must boil ,  he said ,  and began to scrub his hands in 
the basin of hot water with a cake of soap he had brought 
from the camp .  Nick watched his fathers hands scrubbing 
each other with the soap .  While his father washed his hands 
very carefully and thoroughly ,  he talked .  

You see ,  Nick ,  babies are supposed to be born head first ,  
but sometimes theyre not .  When theyre not they make a 
lot of trouble for everybody .  Maybe Ill have to operate on 
this lady .  Well know in a little while .  

When he was satisfied with his hands he went in and went 
to work .  

Pull back that quilt ,  will you ,  George ?  he said .  Id 
rather not touch it .  

Later when he started to operate Uncle George and three 
Indian men held the woman still .  She bit Uncle George on 
the arm and Uncle George said ,  Damn squaw bitch! and 
the young Indian who had rowed Uncle George over laughed 
at him .  Nick held the basin for his father .  It all took a long 
time .  

His father picked the baby up and slapped it to make it 
breathe and handed it to the old woman .  

See ,  its a boy ,  Nick ,  he said .  How do you like being an 
interne ?  



98 INDIAN CAMP 

Nick said ,  All right .  He was looking away so as not to 
see what his father was doing .  

There .  That gets it ,  said his father and put something 
ijito the basin .  

Nick cjidnt look at it .  

Now ,  his father said ,  theres some stitches to put in .  You 
can watch this or not ,  Nick ,  just as you like .  Im going to 
sew up the incision I made .  

Nick did not watch .  His curiosity had been gone for a long 
time .  

His father finished and stood up .  Uncle George and the three 
Indian men stood up .  Nick put the basin out in the kitchen .  

Uncle George looked at his arm .  The young Indian smiled 
reminiscently .  

Til put some peroxide on that ,  George ,  the doctor said .  

He bent over the Indian woman .  She was quiet now and 
her eyes were closed .  She looked very pale .  She did not 
know what had become of the baby or anything .  

Til be back in the morning ,  the doctor said ,  standing up .  
The nurse should be here from St .  Ignace by noon and shell 
bring everything we need .  

He was feeling exalted and talkative as football players are 
in the dressing room after a game .  

Thats one for the medical journal ,  George ,  he said .  
Doing a Caesarian with a jack - knife and sewing it up with 
nine - foot ,  tapered gut leaders .  

Uncle George was standing against the wall ,  looking at his 
arm .  

Oh ,  youre a great man ,  all right ,  he said .  

Ought to have a look at the proud father .  Theyre usually 
the worst sufferers in these little affairs ,  the doctor said .  I 
must say he took it all pretty quietly .  

He pulled back the blanket from the Indians head .  His 
hand came away wet .  He mounted on the edge of the lower 
bunk with the lamp in one hand and looked in .  The Indian 
lay with his face toward the wall .  His throat had been cut 



INDIAN CAMP 99 

from ear to ear .  The blood had flowed down into a pool 
where his body sagged the bunk .  His head rested on his left 
arm .  The open razor lay ,  edge up ,  in the blankets .  

Take Nick out of the shanty ,  George ,  the doctor said .  

There was no need of that .  Nick ,  standing in the -  door of 
the kitchen ,  h*ad a good view of the upper bunk when his 
father ,  the lamp in one hand ,  tipped the Indians head back .  

It was just beginning to be daylight when they walked 
along the logging road back toward the lake .  

Im terribly sorry I brought you along ,  Nickie ,  said his 
father ,  all his post - operative exhilaration gone .  It was an 
awful mess to put you through .  

Do ladies always have such a hard time having babies ?  
Nick asked .  

No ,  that was very ,  very exceptional .  

Why did he kill himself ,  Daddy ?  

I dont know ,  Nick .  He couldnt stand things ,  I guess .  

Do many men kill themselves ,  Daddy ?  

Not very many ,  Nick .  

Do many women ?  

Hardly ever .  

Dont they ever ?  

Oh ,  yes .  They do sometimes .  

Daddy ?  

Yes .  

Where did Uncle George go ?  

Hell turn up all right .  

Is dying hard ,  Daddy ?  

No ,  I think its pretty easy ,  Nick .  It all depends .  

They were seated in the boat ,  Nick in the stern ,  his father 
rowing .  The sun was coming up over the hills .  A bass 
jumped ,  making a circle in the water .  Nick trailed his hand 
in the water .  It felt warm in the sharp chill of the morning .  

In the early morning on the lake sitting in the stern of the 
boat with his father rowing ,  he felt quite sure that he would 
never die .  



Minarets stuck up in the rain out of Adrianople across the mudflats .  
The carts were jammed for thirty miles along the Karagatch road .  
Water buffalo and cattle were hauling carts through the mud .  No end 
and no beginning .  Just carts loaded with everything they owned .  
The old men and women ,  soaked through ,  walked along keeping the 
cattle moving .  The Maritza was running yellow almost up to the 
bridge .  Carts were jammed solid on the bridge with camels bobbing 
along through them .  Greek cavalry herded along the procession .  
Women and kids were in the carts couched with mattresses y mirrors ,  
sewing machines ,  bundles .  There was a woman having a kid with a 
young girl holding a blanket over her and crying .  Scared sick looking 
at it .  It rained all through the evacuation .

DICK BOULTON came from the Indian camp to cut up logs 
for Nicks father .  He brought his son Eddy and another 
Indian named Billy Tabeshaw with him .  They came in 
through the back gate out of the woods ,  Eddy carrying the 
long cross - cut saw .  It flopped over his shoulder and made a 
musical sound as he walked .  Billy Tabeshaw carried two 
big cant - hooks .  Dick had three axes under his arm .  

He turned and shut the gate .  The others went on ahead of 
him down to the lake shore where the logs were buried in the 
sand .  

The logs had been lost from the big log booms that were 
towed down the lake to the mill by the steamer Magic .  They 
had drifted up on to the beach and if nothing were done 
about them sooner or later the crew of the Magic would come 
along the shore in a rowboat ,  spot the logs ,  drive an iron spike 
with a ring on it into the end of each one and then tow them 
out into the lake to make a new boom .  But the lumbermen 
might never come for them because a few logs were not worth

the price of a crew to gather them .  If no one came for them 
they would be left to waterlog and rot on the beach .  

Nicks father always assumed that this was what would 
happen ,  and hired the Indians to come down from the camp 
and cut the logs up with the cross - cut saw and split them with 
a wedge to make cord wood and chunks for the open fire -  
place .  Dick Boulton walked around past the cottage down to 
the lake .  There were four big beech logs lying almost buried 
in the sand .  Eddy hung the saw up by one of its handles in 
the crotch of a tree .  Dick put the three axes down on the 
little dock .  Dick was a half - breed and many of the farmers 
around the lake believed he was really a white man .  He was 
very lazy but a great worker once he was started .  He took a 
plug of tobacco out of his pocket ,  bit off a chew and spoke 
in Ojibway to Eddy and Billy Tabeshaw .  

They sunk the ends of their cant - hooks into one of the 
logs and swung against it to loosen it in the sand .  They 
swung their weight against the shafts of the cant - hooks .  The 
log moved in the sand .  Dick Boulton turned to Nicks father .  

Well ,  Doc ,  he said ,  thats a nice lot of timber youve 
stolen .  

Dont talk that way ,  Dick ,  the doctor said .  Its drift -  
wood .  

Eddy and Billy Tabeshaw had rocked the log out of the 
wet sand and rolled it toward the water .  

Tut it right in ,  Dick Boulton shouted .  

What are you doing that for ?  asked the doctor .  

Wash it off .  Clean off the sand on account of the saw .  I 
want to see who it belongs to ,  Dick said .  

The log was just awash in the lake .  Eddy and Billy Tabe -  
shaw leaned on their cant - hooks sweating in the sun .  Dick 
kneeled down in the sand and looked at the mark of the 
sealers hammer in the wood at the end of the log .  

It belongs to White and McNally ,  5 he said ,  standing up 
and brushing off his trousers knees .  

The doctor was very uncomfortable .  



102 THE DOCTOR AND THE DOCTORS WIFE 

Youd better not saw it up then ,  Dick /  he said ,  shortly .  

Dont get huffy ,  Doc ,  said Dick .  Dont get huffy .  I 
dont care who you steal from .  Its none of my business .  
i If you think the logs are stolen ,  leave them alone and take 
your tools back to the camp ,  the doctor said .  His face was 
red .  r 

Dont go off at half cock ,  Doc ,  Dick said .  He spat tobacco 
juice on the log .  It slid off ,  thinning in the water .  You 
know theyre stolen as well as I do .  It dont make any 
difference to me .  

All right .  If you think the logs are stolen ,  take your stuff 
and get out .  

Now ,  Doc  

Take your stuff and get out .  

Listen ,  Doc .  

If you call me Doc once again ,  Ill knock your eye teeth 
down your throat .  

Oh ,  no ,  you wont ,  Doc .  5 

Dick Boulton looked at the doctor .  Dick was a big man .  
He knew how big a man he was .  He liked to get into fights .  
He was happy .  Eddy and Billy Tabeshaw leaned on their 
cant - hooks and looked at the doctor .  The doctor chewed the 
beard on his lower lip and looked at Dick Boulton .  Then he 
turned away and walked up the hill to the cottage .  They 
could see from his back how angry he was .  They all watched 
him walk up the hill and go inside the cottage .  

Dick said something in Ojibway .  Eddy laughed but Billy 
Tabeshaw looked very serious .  He did not understand Eng -  
lish but he had sweat all the time the row was going on .  He 
was fat with only a few hairs of moustache like a Chinaman .  
He picked up the two cant - hooks .  Dick picked up the axes 
and Eddy took the saw down from the tree .  They started off 
and walked up past the cottage and out the back gate into the 
woods .  Dick left the gate open .  Billy Tabeshaw went back 
and fastened it .  They were gone through the woods .  

In the cottage the doctor ,  sitting on the bed in his room ,  



THE DOCTOR AND THE DOCTORS WIFE 103 

saw a pile of medical journals on the floor by the bureau .  
They were still in their wrappers unopened .  It irritated him .  

Arent you going back to work ,  dear ?  asked the doctors 
wife from the room where she was lying with the blinds 
drawn .  

No! 

Was anything the matter ?  

I had a row with Dick Boulton .  

Oh /  said his wife .  I hope you didnt lose your temper ,  
Henry .  

No ,  said the doctor .  

jjthat he who ruleth his spirit is greater than 
taketh ,  a city ,  said his wife .  She was a Christian 
Scientist .  Her Bible ,  her copy of Science and Health and her 
Quarterly were on a table beside her bed in the darkened 
room .  

Her husband did not answer .  He was sitting on his bed 
now ,  cleaning a shotgun .  He pushed the magazine full of 
the heavy yellow shells and pumped them out again .  They 
were scattered on the bed .  

Henry ,  his wife called .  Then paused a moment .  Henry! 

Yes ,  the doctor said .  

You didnt say anything to Boulton to anger him ,  did you ?  

No ,  said the doctor .  

What was the trouble about ,  dear ?  

Nothing much .  

Tell me ,  Henry .  Please dont try and keep anything from 
me .  What was the trouble about ?  

Well ,  Dick owes me a lot of money for pulling his squaw 
through pneumonia and I guess he wanted a row so he 
wouldnt have to take it out in work .  

His wife was silent .  The doctor wiped his gun carefully 
with a rag .  He pushed the shells back in against the spring 
of the magazine .  He sat with the gun on his knees .  He was 
very fond of it .  Then he heard his wifes voice from the 
darkened room .  



104 THE DOCTOR AND THE DOCTORS WIFE 

Dear ,  I dont think ,  I really dont think that anyone 
would really do a thing like that .  

No ?  the doctor said .  

No .  I cant really believe that anyone would do a thing 
of that sort intentionally .  

The doctor stood up and put the shotgun in the corner 
behind the dresser .  

Are you going out ,  dear ?  his wife said .  

I think Ill go for a walk ,  3 the doctor said .  

If you see Nick ,  dear ,  will you tell him his mother wants 
to see him ?  his wife said .  

The doctor went out on the porch .  The screen door 
slammed behind him .  He heard his wife catch her breath 
when the door slammed .  

Sorry ,  he said ,  outside her window with the blinds 
drawn .  

Its all right ,  dear ,  she said .  

He walked in the heat out the gate and along the path into 
the hemlock woods .  It was cool in the woods even on such a 
hot day .  He found Nick sitting with his back against a tree ,  
reading .  

Your mother wants you to come and see her ,  the doctor 
said .  

I want to go with you ,  Nick said .  

His father looked down at him .  

All right .  Come on ,  then ,  his father said .  Give me .  the 
book ,  Ill put it in my pocket .  

I know where theres black squirrels ,  Daddy ,  Nick said .  

All right /  said his father .  Lets go there .  



We were in a garden at Mons .  Young Buckley came in with his patrol 
from across the river .  The first German I saw climbed up over the 
garden wall .  We waited till he got one leg over and then potted him .  
He had so much equipment on and looked awfully surprised andfeil 
down into the garden .  Then three more came over farther down the 
wall .  We shot* them .  They all came just like that .  



THE END OF SOMETHING 

IN the old days Hortons Bay was a lumbering town .  No one 
who lived in it was out of sound of the big saws in the mill by 
the lake .  Then one year there were no more logs to make 
lumber .  The lumber schooners came into the bay and were 
loaded with the cut of the mill that stood stacked in the yard .  
All the piles of lumber were carried away .  The big mill 
building had all its machinery that was removable taken out 
and hoisted on board one of the schooners by the men who 
had worked in the mill .  The schooner moved out of the bay 
toward the open lake carrying the two great saws ,  the travel -  
ling carriage that hurled the logs against the revolving ,  
circular saws ,  and all the rollers ,  wheels ,  belts and iron piled 
on a hull - deep load of lumber .  Its open hold covered with 
canvas and lashed tight ,  the sails of the schooner filled and 
it moved out into the open lake ,  carrying with it everything 
that had made the mill a mill and Hortons Bay a town .  

The one - story bunk houses ,  the eating - house ,  the company 
store ,  the mill offices ,  and the big mill itself stood deserted in 
the acres of sawdust that covered the swampy meadow by 
the shore of the bay .  

Ten years later there was nothing of the mill left except 
the broken white limestone of its foundations showing through 
the swampy second growth as Nick and Marjorie rowed 
along the shore .  They were trolling along the edge of the 
channel bank where the bottom dropped off suddenly from 



io6 THE END OF SOMETHING 

sandy shallows to twelve feet of dark water .  They were trolling 
on their way to the point to set night lines for rainbow trout .  

Theres our old ruin ,  Nick ,  Marjorie said .  

Nick ,  rowing ,  looked at the white stone in the green trees .  

There it is ,  he said .  

Can you remember when it was a mill ?  Marjorie asked .  

I can just remember ,  Nick said .  

It seems more like a castle ,  Marjorie said .  

Nick said nothing .  They rowed on out of sight of the mill ,  
following the shore line .  Then Nick cut across the bay .  

They arent striking ,  he said .  

No ,  Marjorie said .  She was intent on the rod all the time 
they trolled ,  even when she talked .  She loved to fish .  She 
loved to fish with Nick .  

Close beside the boat a big trout broke the surface of the 
water .  Nick pulled hard on one oar so the boat would turn 
and the bait spinning far behind would pass where the trout 
was feeding .  As the trouts back came up out of the water the 
minnows jumped wildly .  They sprinkled the surface like a 
handful of shot thrown into the water .  Another trout broke 
water ,  feeding on the other side of the boat .  

Theyre feeding ,  Marjorie said .  

But they wont strike ,  Nick said .  

He rowed the boat around to troll past both the feeding 
fish ,  then headed it for the point .  Marjorie did not reel in 
until the boat touched the shore .  

They pulled the boat up the beach and Nick lifted out a 
pail of live perch .  The perch swam in the water in the pail .  
Nick caught three of them with his hands and cut their heads 
off and skinned them while Marjorie chased with her hands 
in the bucket ,  finally caught a perch ,  cut its head off and 
skinned it .  Nick looked at her fish .  

You dont want to take the ventral fin out ,  he said .  Til 
be all right for bait but its better with the ventral fin in .  

He hooked each of the skinned perch through the tail .  
There were two hooks attached to a leader on each rod .  



THE END OF SOMETHING 107 

Then Marjorie rowed the boat out over the channel - bank ,  
holding the line in her teeth ,  and looking toward Nick ,  who 
stood on the shore holding the rod and letting the line run 
out from the reel .  

Thats about right ,  he called .  

Should I let it drop ?  Marjorie called back ,  holding the 
line in her hand .  

Sure .  Let it go .  Marjorie dropped the line overboard and 
watched the baits go down through the water .  

She came in with the boat and ran the second line out the 
same way .  Each time Nick set a heavy slab of driftwood 
across the butt of the rod to hold it solid and propped it up 
at an angle with a small slab .  He reeled in the slack line so 
the line ran taut out to where the bait rested on the sandy 
floor of the channel and set the click on the reel .  When a 
trout ,  feeding on the bottom ,  took the bait it would run with 
it ,  taking line out of the reel in a rush and making the reel 
sing with the click on .  

Marjorie rowed up the point a little way so she would not 
disturb the line .  She pulled hard on the oars and the boat 
went way up the beach .  Little waves came in with it .  Mar -  
jorie stepped out of the boat and Nick pulled the boat high 
up the beach .  

Whats the matter ,  Nick ?  Marjorie asked .  

I dont know ,  5 Nick said ,  getting wood for a fire .  

They made a fire with driftwood .  Marjorie went to the 
boat and brought a blanket .  The evening breeze blew the 
smoke toward the point ,  so Marjorie spread the blanket out 
between the fire and the lake .  

Marjorie sat on the blanket with her back to the fire and 
waited for Nkk .  He came over and sat down beside her on 
the blanket .  In back of them was the close second - growth 
timber of the point and in front was the bay with the mouth 
of Hortons Creek .  It was not quite dark .  The fire - light went 
as far as the water .  They could both see the two steel rods 
at an angle over the dark water .  The fire glinted on the reels .  



io8 THE END OF SOMETHING 

Marjorie unpacked the basket of supper .  

I dont feel like eating ,  said Nick .  

Come on and eat ,  Nick .  

All right .  

They ate without talking ,  and watched the two rods and 
the fire - light in the water .  

Theres going to be a moon to - night ,  said Nick .  He looked 
across the bay to the hills that were beginning to sharpen 
against the sky .  Beyond the hills he knew the moon was 
coming up .  

I know it ,  Marjorie said happily .  

You know everything ,  Nick said .  

Oh ,  Nick ,  please cut it out! Please ,  please dont be that 
way! 

I cant help it ,  Nick said .  You do .  You know every -  
thing .  Thats the trouble .  You know you do .  

Marjorie did not say anything .  

Ive taught you everything .  You know you do .  What 
dont you know ,  anyway ?  

Oh ,  shut up /  Marjorie said .  There comes the moon .  

They sat on the blanket without touching each other and 
watched the moon rise .  

You dont have to talk silly /  Marjorie said .  Whats really 
the matter ?  

I dont know .  

Of course you know .  

No ,  I dont .  

*Go on and say it .  

Nick looked on at the moon ,  coming up over the hills .  

It isnt fun any more .  

He was afraid to look at Marjorie .  Then he looked at her .  
She sat there with her back toward him .  He looked at her 
back .  It isnt fun any more .  Not any of it .  

She didnt say anything .  He went on .  I feel as though 
everything was gone to hell inside of me .  I dont know ,  
Marge .  I dont know what to say .  



THE END OF SOMETHING 109 

He looked on at her back .  

Isnt love any fun ?  Marjorie said .  

No ,  Nick said .  Marjorie stood up .  Nick sat there ,  his 
head in his hands .  

Im going to take the boat ,  Marjorie called to him .  You 
can walk back around the point .  

All right ,  Nick said .  Til push the boat off for you .  

You dont need to ,  she said .  She was afloat in the boat on 
the water with the moonlight on it .  Nick went back and lay 
down with his face in the blanket by the fire .  He could hear 
Marjorie rowing on the water .  

He lay there for a long time .  He lay there while he heard 
Bill come into the clearing walking around through the 
woods .  He felt Bill coming up to the fire .  Bill didnt touch 
him ,  either .  

Did she go all right ?  Bill said .  

Yes ,  Nick said ,  lying ,  his face on the blanket .  

Have a scene ?  

No ,  there wasnt any scene .  

How do you feel ?  

Oh ,  go away ,  Bill! Go away for a while .  

Bill selected a sandwich from the lunch basket and walked 
over to have a look at the rods .  



 /  /  was a frightfully hot day .  Wed jammed an absolutely perfect barri -  
cade across the bridge .  It was simply priceless .  A big old wrought -  
iron grating from the front of a house .  Too heavy to lift and you could 
shot through it and they would have to climb over it .  It was abso -  
lutely topping .  They tried to get over it ,  and we potted them from 
forty yards .  They rushed it ,  and officers came out alone and worked 
on it .  It was an absolutely perfect obstacle .  Their officers were very 
jine .  We were frightfully put out when we heard the flank had gone ,  
and we had to fall back .  



THE THREE - DAY BLOW 

THE rain stopped as Nick turned into the road that went up 
through the orchard .  The fruit had been picked and the fall 
wind blew through the bare trees .  Nick stopped and picked 
up a Wagner apple from beside the road ,  shiny in the brown 
grass from the rain .  He put the apple in the pocket of his 
Mackinaw coat .  

The road came out of the orchard on to the top of the hill .  
There was the cottage ,  the porch bare ,  smoke coming from the 
chimney .  In back was the garage ,  the chicken coop and the 
second - growth timber like a hedge against the woods behind .  
The big trees swayed far over in the wind as he watched .  It 
was the first of the autumn storms .  

As Nick crossed the open field above the orchard the door 
of the cottage opened and Bill came out .  He stood on the 
porch looking out .  

Well ,  Wemedge ?  he said .  

Hey ,  Bill ,  Nick said ,  coming up the steps .  

They stood together ,  looking out across the country ,  down 
over the orchard ,  beyond the road ,  across the lower fields and 
the woods of the point to the lake .  The wind was blowing 
straight down the lake .  They could see the surf along Ten 
Mile point .
